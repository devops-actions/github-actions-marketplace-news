## What's Changed

# v2.13.0

Released 2026-07-02.

Run-safety guardrails and per-role endpoint configuration.

## Fixes (run safety)
- GitHub backlog auto-sync is now opt-in and off by default. Previously a run in a repository with open GitHub issues would pull every open issue into the backlog before task scoping, which could silently discard a seeded goal and spawn work against the entire issue list. Enable it explicitly with the `github.sync_backlog` seed config key (or the `BERNSTEIN_SYNC_GITHUB_BACKLOG` env override). (#2178)
- A seeded goal is no longer silently dropped when the backlog is non-empty: the run now prints a loud warning naming the precedence and how to force the goal, instead of quietly planning from the backlog. (#2178)
- Agent worktree merges refuse to land on the repository default branch. The merge and push path resolves the protected default (origin/HEAD, then `init.defaultBranch`, then the conventional names, treating both `main` and `master` as protected when the remote head is ambiguous) and refuses to merge or push agent work onto it, recording the refusal, so a run started from a default-branch checkout can no longer push unreviewed commits straight to the trunk. (#2178)

## Features (per-role model configuration)
- `role_model_policy` entries gain optional `base_url` and `api_key_env` next to `model`/`provider`, so different roles can target different OpenAI-compatible endpoints in one workflow (for example a fast manager endpoint and cheaper worker endpoints). `api_key_env` names an environment variable and is validated against the same fail-closed provider allowlist as the runner. YAML anchors give reuse across roles with no new file format. Absent fields keep today's behavior. (#2159)
- `ModeProfile` gains `top_p`, `top_k`, and `max_tokens` beside its existing `temperature`, and the previously-deferred `apply_mode_to_spawn` wiring is completed so a mode profile's sampling parameters actually reach the spawn and the runner manifest. (#2159)
- Opt-in builtin tools for the openai_agents runner, for runs without an MCP gateway, selected by `tool_source: builtin` (the gateway remains the default). `read_file`, `write_file`, and `list_dir` are workdir-confined (absolute and parent-escape paths are rejected). `run_command` is a restricted process-exec primitive: bare-name commands only, shell interpreters blocked, resolved against PATH, available only under a configured OS sandbox provider or an explicit opt-in; its filesystem confinement is the OS sandbox, not the builtin. Every builtin call is recorded to the run event log so a gateway-free run stays auditable. (#2159)

## Quality
- Resolved refurb FURB123 findings in the OWASP control-map builders.

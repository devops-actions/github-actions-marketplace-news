## What's Changed

# v3.4.2

Released 2026-07-12.

A patch release on top of v3.4.1. It wires the cost-aware batch and cache
policies into the live run loop, runs the adapter conformance suite on a real
Windows CI runner, and makes the packaged distribution image verifiable. There
are no breaking changes and no configuration migration is required.

## Cost-aware scheduling now live in the run loop

- Batch routing is enforced during dispatch. Before a single-task batch is
  spawned, the run resolves the adapter that would run the task and takes the
  capability-gated routing decision: a batch-eligible task reaches a provider
  batch endpoint only on an adapter that has one, a task that is not
  batch-eligible never routes to batch, and a batch-eligible task on an adapter
  with no batch surface runs interactively rather than being faked onto a batch
  path that does not exist. Each routing decision is recorded as a verifiable
  `cost.batch_route` audit-chain entry.
- Cache-window fan-out is wired into the tournament fan-out. When the resolved
  adapter supports a prompt-cache window and the operator has opted in, one
  warm-up call primes the shared prompt prefix before the sibling attempts
  spawn, so each attempt hits the warm cache instead of racing to write it. The
  feature stays off by default.

## Windows conformance on a real Windows runner

- The adapter conformance suite for the claude, codex, and gemini adapters now
  runs on a `windows-latest` CI runner and exercises the real spawn, stop, and
  restart contract against a cross-platform fake-CLI harness, alongside the
  Windows worktree-isolation contract. This replaces the previous mock-only
  Windows coverage for those paths.
- The fake-CLI test harness is cross-platform: it installs a batch shim on
  Windows and a shell wrapper on Unix, and the fake reads its own configuration
  so the same integration tests drive a real subprocess on every runner.
- The count of platform-reason test skips is reduced, with the file-mode and
  permission cases and the canary worktree round-trip now running on every
  platform.

## Packaging

- Signed-image provenance verification. The MCP registry listing and the Docker
  catalog entry are checked, offline, to resolve to the same signed container
  image pinned to the release version. A new `bernstein skills package
  image-verify` command surfaces the verdict, and the release manifest check
  fails a release that would publish a listing pointing at a different or
  unsigned image. The registry and plugin manifests are version-synced with the
  release.

## Upgrading

```bash
pipx upgrade bernstein     # or: uv tool upgrade bernstein
```

No configuration migration is required. Every capability available in v3.4.1
is unchanged.

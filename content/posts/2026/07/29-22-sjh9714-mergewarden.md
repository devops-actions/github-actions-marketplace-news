  MergeWarden automates the triage process of AI-related pull requests to ensure that they meet certain quality standards before being merged. It helps maintain code quality by checking if PRs are self-contained, have clear descriptions, and do not exceed review limits. The tool flags potential issues such as oversized files, missing linked issues, and coding comments from AI tools. MergeWarden gates its own pull requests to avoid errors in triage processes.

## Action Summary

MergeWarden automates the triage process of AI-related pull requests to ensure that they meet certain quality standards before being merged. It helps maintain code quality by checking if PRs are self-contained, have clear descriptions, and do not exceed review limits. The tool flags potential issues such as oversized files, missing linked issues, and coding comments from AI tools. MergeWarden gates its own pull requests to avoid errors in triage processes.

## What's Changed

[v0.6.0](release-notes-v0.6.0.md) stopped MergeWarden from blocking a pull
request over a convention nobody has adopted. This release stops it from
nagging about one. Same principle, one step further: **speak about what a pull
request did, not about what it did not declare.**

## Why

Installing the tool and then reading what it says every day are different
experiences, and only the first one was ever measured here. The second one
looked like this: every routine agent pull request — in scope, nothing
dangerous — produced `contract/missing` at `warn`, which resolved the whole
pull request to `NEEDS REVIEW`. Nothing was wrong with those pull requests. The
scan study measured **0 of 2,204** merged agent pull requests declaring a scope,
so the rule fires on essentially all of them, essentially always.

A signal that fires on everything is not a signal. Within a week a maintainer
learns to skip it, and `workflow/permission-escalation` and
`agent-control-plane/drift` — the findings this project exists to surface — get
skipped along with it.

## `contract/missing` now defaults to `info`

```yaml
contract:
  missing_severity: info # or: warn, error
```

`info` findings are recorded in the report and do not affect the decision. A
routine agent pull request now reports `agent/origin-detected` and
`contract/missing`, both informational, and resolves to **`pass`**.

The escalation path is unchanged and still one line: raise it to `warn` once you
have asked contributors to declare scope, and to `error` once they do.
`contract/invalid`, `contract/out-of-scope` and `contract/blocked-path` stay
`error` — each fires on something a pull request did against its own declaration.

`allow_missing_in_observe_mode` is now a **no-op**. It downgraded
`contract/missing` to `warn` in observe mode, which made sense against an
`error` default; against an `info` default the same code would _raise_ the
severity a repository had deliberately configured. The key is still accepted so
existing configuration keeps parsing.

## The Action comments only when there is something to say

`comment` now takes `auto`, `always`, or `never`. `true` and `false` keep
working and mean `always` and `never`.

| Value    | Behaviour                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `never`  | Never touches the pull request. Still the default.               |
| `auto`   | Comments only on an error, a warning, or an incomplete analysis. |
| `always` | Comments on every run, including a clean pass.                   |

Before this release the Action posted on **every** run it was enabled for,
including a passing one — a `PASSED` comment on every pull request, forever.

`auto` also resolves what it posted: if a run commented and a later run passes,
the existing comment is **updated** to the passing report rather than deleted,
so a stale `NEEDS REVIEW` cannot outlive the problem it described.

The default stays `never`, because the install documented in the README grants
`pull-requests: read` and commenting needs `write`. The README now recommends
`comment: auto` with `pull-requests: write`, which is the configuration worth
having. Note that pull requests from forks receive a read-only token on the
`pull_request` event regardless of what the workflow requests.

## Also

[`docs/start-here.md`](start-here.md) is a new one-page introduction: install,
what the first pull request will look like, and one line explaining each
finding. This project has 38 documents and no front door.

## Breaking

No API breaks. Two default behaviours change:

- An agent pull request whose only issue is a missing contract now resolves to
  `pass` instead of `needs-review`. Set `contract.missing_severity: warn` to
  restore the previous behaviour.
- `allow_missing_in_observe_mode` no longer changes anything. If you set
  `missing_severity: error` and relied on observe mode softening it, the
  reported severity is now `error` there too. The observe-mode decision is
  `pass` either way, so no gate changes.

## Upgrading

```yaml
- uses: sjh9714/mergewarden@v0.9.0
```

No configuration change required.

  OpenACA is an open-source tool that analyzes the composition of AI agents, resolving stable identities for components like plugins, MCP servers, and bundled dependencies. It builds a Composition Bill of Materials (BOM) and matches them against security advisories to provide risk attribution and advisory intelligence. The tool helps identify vulnerabilities in agent-installation surfaces that traditional SCA tools do not address.

## Action Summary

OpenACA is an open-source tool that analyzes the composition of AI agents, resolving stable identities for components like plugins, MCP servers, and bundled dependencies. It builds a Composition Bill of Materials (BOM) and matches them against security advisories to provide risk attribution and advisory intelligence. The tool helps identify vulnerabilities in agent-installation surfaces that traditional SCA tools do not address.

## What's Changed

# 0.4.0 — Exposure reports, capability descriptors, source-stable identity

This release adds the exposure-report surface (`openaca triage` and
`scan --report exposure`), teaches the Agent BOM to carry capability
descriptors, and resets component identity to be source-stable and
optional — the three layers Fleet-style consumers roll up on.

## Highlights

- **Exposure reports (`openaca triage`).** A new command turns structured
  scan JSON into a ranked exposure report: one card per risky component
  with severity, composition path, evidence list, recommended action, and
  confidence — instead of a wall of findings. The same report is available
  directly from a scan via `--report exposure`, in text or Markdown.
  Malware removal is prioritized above posture actions, and the decision
  contract (evidence kinds, actions) is shared so other consumers rank
  exposures the same way the CLI does.

- **Capability descriptors in the Agent BOM (ADR-0041, plan 037).**
  Components now carry declared capability descriptors — a closed taxonomy
  (network client, shell exec, filesystem, credential access, and friends)
  extracted from what manifests declare: launch commands, hook commands,
  remote MCP URLs. Every capability claim requires evidence. A curated,
  coordinate-constrained capability corpus (with its own linter and CI
  gate) supplements extraction for known components, and `openaca bom diff`
  reports capability changes between snapshots.

- **Source-stable, optional component identity (ADR-0042, plan 038).**
  `openaca:identity` is now derived only from an authoritative
  implementation source — npm/PyPI package, GitHub repo, marketplace
  plugin, remote URL — and is **absent** when no reliable source exists.
  User-chosen aliases (the `fs` in `mcpServers.fs`) no longer mint
  identities, so two unrelated servers configured under the same alias can
  never merge in cross-BOM rollups, and the same server under different
  aliases joins correctly. Display labels keep using aliases; the logical
  join key does not. Every component keeps a BOM-unique `bom_ref`
  occurrence key, preserved through both graph and flat scan paths, so
  findings stay attributable even when identity is absent.

- **Bug fixes.** Launcher classification respects shell quoting,
  env-assignment prefixes, PyPI extras/specifiers, and Windows launcher
  extensions; non-registry npm/PyPI launch specs no longer mint package
  identities; GitHub-sourced identity survives graph BOM construction;
  skill subject-coordinate paths are redacted before remote upload; and
  triage Markdown output escapes labels, evidence IDs, and line endings.

## Install

`uv tool install openaca==0.4.0` or `pip install openaca==0.4.0`. Or:
`curl -fsSL https://openaca.dev/install.sh | sh`.

## Compatibility

Pre-V0 — no back-compat hedging.

- **`openaca:schema_version` bumps `0.2` → `0.4`** (two format changes in
  one release: `0.3` added capability descriptor properties, `0.4` is the
  identity reset). No published release ever emitted `0.3` — released
  BOMs jump straight from `0.2` to `0.4`. Consumers keying on this field
  should treat `0.4` as the capability + identity-reset format.
- **`openaca:identity` is now optional.** Alias-derived identities
  (`mcp-server/<alias>`) are gone; components without a stable source have
  no identity property. Downstream consumers must treat identity as a
  nullable cross-BOM join key and use `bom_ref` as the per-BOM occurrence
  key (ADR-0042). Identity shapes for sourced components changed to
  role-qualified source coordinates (e.g.
  `mcp-server/npm/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`).
- **New CLI surface:** `openaca triage` and `scan --report exposure`.

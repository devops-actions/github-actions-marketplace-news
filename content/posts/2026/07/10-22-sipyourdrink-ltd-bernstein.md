## What's Changed

# v3.2.0

Released 2026-07-10.

A resumability and availability release. Interrupted runs continue from a
verified ledger instead of starting over, provider outages reroute along
declared fallback chains with a receipt for every decision, and certified
local endpoints join the worker pool behind a certification gate.

## Durable work ledger (#2358)

An interrupted orchestration run no longer discards finished work. The
scheduler records every task transition in a Merkle-chained work ledger:

- Every state transition of the task graph appends a redacted,
  content-addressed ledger entry whose hash links its predecessor, using the
  same canonical-JSON contract as the per-step replay journal.
- `bernstein ledger resume` rebuilds scheduler state purely by replaying the
  chain and re-dispatches only tasks without a completion entry. Completed
  work is never re-run.
- The ledger is machine-portable: clone the repository on another machine and
  resume there with zero lost completed work. Tampering or divergence
  surfaces as a hash mismatch at an exact position, never as a silent merge.
- `bernstein resume <task-id>` picks up a single paused, killed, or crashed
  task from its last checkpoint and points at the ledger when the id matches
  a portable run.

## Checkpointed retries (#2359)

A failed task retry no longer has to start cold. When the native agent
session recorded a checkpoint, the retry engine resumes it warm:

- Warm resume replays the recorded session checkpoint with a templated
  corrective instruction, so in-context progress is preserved.
- Fork branches a fresh session off the checkpoint and leaves the original
  session intact. Cold restart stays the always-safe fallback.
- Every decision (warm, fork, or the downgrade reason that forced cold) is
  anchored in the journal and mirrored to the audit chain, so a retry replays
  identically and the decision trail survives the worktree.

## Provider availability policy (#2355)

Provider outages reroute instead of failing the spawn. Roles declare a
fallback chain, and failover is a deterministic, receipted decision:

- Per-role fallback chains list providers in preference order; health probes
  are cached with an explicit TTL so dispatch bursts do not re-probe.
- Chain resolution is deterministic: the same policy and probe results always
  produce the same decision hash, and every failover lands a journal receipt
  mirrored to the audit chain.
- `bernstein doctor --failover-drill` exercises every declared chain against
  simulated outages and reports the route each role would take, before a real
  outage forces the question.

## Local-model worker tier (#2356)

OpenAI-compatible local endpoints can now serve worker roles behind a
certification gate:

- `bernstein doctor --endpoint` runs the conformance suite against an
  endpoint and produces a signed certification receipt; certified endpoint
  profiles are the only ones the config gate accepts for role assignments.
- Certification receipts are anchored to the audit chain, so an assignment
  can always be traced back to the exact probe run that admitted the
  endpoint.
- Three verified local configurations are documented in the local-endpoints
  reference, each reproduced from its certification receipt.

## Cross-adapter coordination (#2357)

Workers on different adapters now coordinate through a signed task mailbox
instead of ad-hoc files:

- Every mailbox message is HMAC-chained and Ed25519-signed; the response to a
  post is the signed journal entry itself.
- The claim API is dependency-gated: a task cannot be claimed until the tasks
  it depends on have verified completions, and every claim emits a claim
  receipt into the audit chain.
- Delivery is replay-identical: replaying the same journal reproduces the
  same message order and the same claim outcomes, byte for byte.

## Housekeeping

- Resolved all open scanner alerts in the new feature code: applied the
  suggested idiom cleanups, restricted the endpoint conformance transport to
  http/https handlers only, and added containment checks for filenames
  derived from session and approval ids.
- Dependency updates, including a pip lockfile bump past CVE-2026-8643.

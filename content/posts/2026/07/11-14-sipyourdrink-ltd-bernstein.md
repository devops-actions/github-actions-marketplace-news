## What's Changed

# v3.3.0

Released 2026-07-11.

An operator-capability release. The dashboard gains authentication with
scoped tokens whose every decision lands a governance receipt, a new agy
adapter joins the matrix with a nightly conformance canary sealing its
probe results, and the run review board projects the run journal into a
web view backed by sealed evidence bundles. Groundwork lands for Windows
parity and for installing bernstein as an agent skill or plugin.

## Dashboard authentication and scoped tokens (#2366)

The dashboard is no longer an all-or-nothing surface. Operators issue
scoped credentials, and every authentication decision is a receipt:

- Password login and scoped bearer tokens coexist; tokens carry either a
  read-only or an operator scope, and route access is enforced per scope.
- Token grants and revocations are signed journal rows; a tampered grant
  fails signature verification and is treated as no grant at all.
- Every allow or deny decision is recorded as a governance journal
  receipt, so an access review can reconstruct exactly who reached which
  surface and under which credential.
- `bernstein dashboard-token` issues, lists, and revokes tokens from the
  CLI; revocation is itself a signed journal row, never a silent delete.

## agy adapter and adapter conformance canary (#2368)

agy joins the adapter matrix, and adapter contracts are now exercised
nightly instead of waiting for a user's broken run:

- The agy adapter maps goals onto the agy CLI with the same contract
  surface as every other adapter, including golden transcripts and a
  contract fixture.
- A nightly canary probes every primary adapter against whatever upstream
  version is installed; each probe result is a sealed, content-addressed
  receipt mirrored into the audit chain.
- A last-green table names the newest upstream version each adapter
  passed with, and every row carries the hash of the receipt that
  attested it. `bernstein doctor` reads the same projection and advises
  when the installed version is newer than the last attested one.
- Issue automation is threshold-gated and deduplicated: one upstream
  flake never opens an issue, and the same failure fingerprint never
  opens two.

## Run review board core (#2365)

Finished runs can now be reviewed on a board instead of by reading raw
journals:

- The board is a deterministic projection of the run journal: the same
  journal always produces the same board state, byte for byte, with no
  hand-maintained status anywhere.
- A web view lists runs with their outcomes, decisions, and artefacts,
  consuming sealed evidence bundles so what the reviewer sees is what the
  journal attests.
- Further review-board phases (annotations, sign-off flows) are tracked
  separately.

## Windows parity groundwork (#2367)

The platform layer gains the pieces Windows needs, validated so far on
the existing test matrix:

- Process cleanup emits reap receipts into the audit chain, so a killed
  worker tree is reconstructable after the fact on every platform.
- Job Object process management groups worker processes on Windows the
  way process groups do on POSIX, closing the orphaned-child gap.
- Worktree isolation is junction-aware, so per-task isolation survives
  filesystems where symlinks require elevation.
- Full validation on Windows runners is tracked separately.

## Agent skill and plugin packaging groundwork (#2369)

Installing bernstein as an agent skill or plugin gets its packaging
foundation:

- `bernstein skills package` builds a skill/plugin bundle from the
  packaged templates, with a manifest generated from the package version
  so the bundle can never drift from the release.
- Each install produces a lineage receipt, so an installed bundle can be
  traced back to the exact release artefact it came from.
- Remaining distribution surfaces are tracked separately.

## Housekeeping

- Resolved all open scanner alerts: applied suggested idiom cleanups,
  moved dashboard password comparison onto a computationally expensive
  key derivation, and annotated two exception-name-only log lines as
  scanner false positives.
- Dependency updates.

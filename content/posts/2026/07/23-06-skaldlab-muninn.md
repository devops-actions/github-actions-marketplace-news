actionSummary: |
  Muninn is an open-source security scanning tool designed to integrate with GitHub Actions workflows. It automates the process of identifying vulnerabilities across various tools, normalizes their output, and presents findings in a unified format as comments on pull requests, SARIF uploads, and structured JSON. Muninn uses eight popular vulnerability scanners to detect secrets, pipeline misconfigurations, syntax errors, supply chain risks, application SAST issues, dependency vulnerabilities, container image vulnerabilities, and infrastructure-as-code misconfigurations, providing a comprehensive security scan of GitHub Actions pipelines and self-hosted CI environments.

## What's Changed

# Changelog

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Docker image scanner updates: zizmor 1.28.0 (replaces yanked 1.27.0);
  GitPython floor raised to >=3.1.52 for checkov-transitive GHSA highs
  (checkov remains at 3.2.531 pending aiohttp cap lift).
- Go toolchain bumped to 1.26.5.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Docker image scanner updates: semgrep 1.170.0, zizmor 1.27.0 (checkov
  remains at 3.2.531 pending aiohttp cap lift).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Docker image scanner updates: osv-scanner 2.4.0, trivy 0.72.0, semgrep
  1.168.0, zizmor 1.26.1 (checkov remains at 3.2.531 pending aiohttp cap lift).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- Trivy default severity is now all levels (`UNKNOWN` through `CRITICAL`) instead
  of `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` only. osv-scanner and trivy now overlap on
  medium/low advisories by default so cross-scanner dedup and `Detected by`
  work without extra config. Consumers can narrow the Trivy scan with
  `scanners.trivy.severity`; `fail-on` still controls which findings fail the run.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Suppressions with `tool` and/or `rule-id` are now applied. Previously only `id`
  (path substring) and `fingerprint` matchers worked; tool+rule-id entries
  parsed from `muninn.yml` but silently no-op'd.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Poutine v1.x JSON parsing: findings from poutine 1.1.6+ (`rule_id`, `meta`,
  `rules`, `blobshas`) now populate title, rule, and file in PR comments instead
  of empty shells (`File: :0`, `Rule: ``) (#41).
- Actionlint PR comments: fall back to `kind` (e.g. `expression`) when
  `rule.name` is absent; omit empty Rule lines.
- Poutine injection findings: render `injection_sources` as formatted
  **Sources** instead of plain `meta.details` text.

### Changed
- PR comment layout: shared field helpers; non-dependency findings follow
  File → Rule → optional extras → description; single-scanner dependency
  findings use **File** instead of a redundant **Source** line.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Cross-scanner deduplication by advisory id: findings that report the same
  CVE/GHSA for the same package from different scanners (e.g. OSV-Scanner from a
  lockfile and Trivy from a container layer) are now collapsed into a single
  finding. The contributing scanners are recorded in a new `detected_by` field
  (surfaced in the JSON report, the PR comment's "Detected by" line, and a
  `detectedBy` SARIF result property). A CVE is preferred over GHSA so the same
  vulnerability converges on one id across scanners (#27).
- Richer dependency finding rendering: aggregated dependency findings now appear
  under a neutral `[dependency]` heading (instead of a single scanner's name)
  with `Package`, `Advisory` (including the shared CVE), `Detected by`, and a
  `Sources` list showing where each scanner observed it. A new `sources` field on
  the finding (per-scanner `tool` + `file`) backs the JSON report (#27).

### Fixed
- PR comment rendering: scanner descriptions are flattened to a single line and
  their Markdown (code fences, headings) neutralized, so an unbalanced ``` fence
  can no longer swallow later findings and the footer into a code block.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-15

Supply-chain hardening for the scanner image and signed, verifiable releases
(closes #30).

### Added
- Pinned every bundled binary scanner to an exact version with SHA256 checksum
  verification in the Docker image — gitleaks, zizmor, actionlint, poutine,
  osv-scanner, trivy (#31)
- Hash-locked the pip-installed scanners (semgrep, checkov, zizmor) via a fully
  pinned, multi-arch `requirements-scanners.txt` installed with
  `pip --require-hashes` (#33)
- Renovate configuration to auto-PR scanner version bumps, with a CI job that
  refreshes the pinned checksums (#32)
- Keyless (OIDC) cosign signing of the published container image and of the
  release binary checksums (Sigstore bundle `checksums.txt.sigstore.json`) (#34)
- SBOM (SPDX) attached to every release and as an image attestation (#34)
- Max-mode SLSA build provenance attestation on the container image (#34)
- "Verifying releases" instructions in the README (#34)

### Changed
- Pinned checkov to 3.2.531 (from 3.3.1) so its dependency tree resolves the
  patched aiohttp 3.14.1 and drops the unfixable python-ecdsa Minerva
  dependency that checkov 3.3.x introduced. Revisit when a newer checkov lifts
  its `aiohttp<3.14` cap (#33)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- 8 security scanners: gitleaks, zizmor, actionlint, poutine,
  semgrep, osv-scanner, trivy, checkov
- Unified Finding schema with fingerprinting
- Three output formats: SARIF 2.1.0, JSON, GitHub PR comment
- GitHub Action with outputs
- Config-driven scanner behavior via muninn.yml
- Suppression management with expiry dates
- 90%+ test coverage enforced in CI
- Integration tests with real scanner binaries
- Self-scan: Muninn scans itself on every PR

## Action Summary

Totem is a file-based toolkit designed to enhance collaboration with AI coding agents by maintaining architectural context and enforcing coding standards. It solves common issues like agents forgetting context, reinventing existing solutions, and compromising architectural integrity by using a deterministic lint engine, queryable knowledge index, and markdown-based rules to guide and constrain agent behavior. Key functionalities include offline linting, architectural rule enforcement, and providing a structured framework to ensure code quality and consistency in AI-assisted development workflows.

## What's Changed

### Minor Changes

-   c0c4496: feat(cli+core): WWND Claim-Discipline Gate infrastructure + Rule 1 — `totem doctor --claim-discipline` (Proposal 279 PR α)

    Ships the infrastructure half of [mmnto-ai/totem-strategy#338](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/pull/338) (Proposal 279 — WWND Claim-Discipline Gate, merged at `670b635a`). Rules 2-5 + calibration land in PR β per the cross-stream two-PR shape decided at [2026-05-16T20:35Z](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-substrate/blob/main/.handoff/totem-claude/processed/2026-05-16T2035Z-strategy-claude.md).

    **Three additions to `LedgerEventSchema`:**

    -   `claim_discipline_finding` joins the activity-event z.enum sibling family. Emitted by `totem doctor --claim-discipline` when a WWND rule fires on a public-surface diff; `ruleId` carries the WWND rule hash and `activity_name` carries the surface (README.md / AGENTS.md / design-tenets.md / docs/wiki).
    -   `cli_version` — optional string field carrying the `@mmnto/cli` semver that produced the event. Useful for correlating gate behavior with releases. Available to all activity events, not just claim-discipline.
    -   `addressed_in_pr` — optional boolean recording whether a `claim_discipline_finding` was addressed inside the same PR that introduced it. Computed at merge time by post-merge replay against the PR-body justification heading.

    All schema changes are additive — no migration cost for existing manifests or ledgers. Promotion to `z.discriminatedUnion` stays deferred to A.3.c per the existing OQ-1 comment.

    **New `@mmnto/totem` error code:** `CLAIM_DISCIPLINE_FAILED` joins `TotemErrorCode`.

    **New `totem doctor --claim-discipline` subcommand.** Sibling to `--compliance` (queued for A.3.b). Three modes:

    1.  **Default** — surfaces all findings via log.warn / log.error; gate passes unless an `error`-severity finding fires.
    2.  **`--strict`** — promotes `warning`-severity findings to gate failures. The pre-push hook invokes `--claim-discipline --strict` per Proposal 279 Q3.
    3.  **`TOTEM_GATE_BYPASS_JUSTIFICATION` env var** — non-empty value records the justification on emitted ledger events and passes the gate regardless of finding severity. Standardized cohort-wide convention from Proposal 279 Q3, mirroring `TOTEM_DRIFT_JUSTIFICATION` from [mmnto-ai/totem#1939](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem/pull/1939).

    **Discovery convention:** WWND rules are recognized by their `lessonHeading` starting with `"WWND Rule "`. Filename-based discovery (`.totem/lessons/wwnd-*.md`) was considered but adds a two-pass walk; heading-prefix lookup is one-pass against the already-loaded rule set.

    **In-scope surfaces:** README.md, AGENTS.md, design-tenets.md (literal, existence-gated), plus recursive walk of `docs/wiki/**` for `.md` files. The recursive walk is a ~10-line zero-dep alternative to the glob package; full glob support deferred to PR β when it becomes load-bearing.

    **Pre-push hook integration.** Slot 6 in the existing pre-push sequence, after `verify-badges`. Fires only when at least one in-scope surface exists. Bypass: `TOTEM_GATE_BYPASS_JUSTIFICATION="<reason>" git push`.

    **Rule 1 (Absolute-promise detection)** lands as a Pipeline 1 lesson with inline regex pattern from Proposal 279 § Scope:

    ```regex
    \b(?:[Ww]ill\s+(?:stay|remain|always\s+be|never\s+(?:change|move))|
        [Ww]on['']t\s+(?:change|ever)|
        [Gg]uarantees|
        [Pp]romises\s+to)\b
    ```

    Severity: `warning`. Scope: README.md, AGENTS.md, design-tenets.md, and `docs/wiki/` (recursive). Mechanizes Tenet 19 § How to apply item 4 (covenant claims must name structural backing or soften to present-tense intent). Empirical seed corpus: N=4 within 24h on 2026-05-15 (mmnto-ai/totem#1925, #1932, #1933), all caught post-merge by external review.

    Compiles via Pipeline 1 (manual regex, zero LLM call) per the A3 hybrid rule-authoring criterion: when the proposal specifies the exact pattern, the rule lands deterministic and the lesson documents the pattern post-hoc.

    **Compile Drift Justification.** The Pipeline 1 add for Rule 1 triggered known compile-corpus drift on 130 sibling rule hashes (lesson sources unchanged; only `lessonHash` rotated). This is the corpus-drift class named in [Proposal 278 § Action 4](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/blob/main/proposals/active/278-compile-worker-determinism-interim-policy.md) (mmnto-ai/totem#1938) and Proposal 281 (axis-4, strategy-Claude drafting in parallel). The new compile output is internally consistent: `verify-manifest` passes (482 rules, hashes match). The drift gate is operating as designed — registering the rotation rather than preventing it (prevention requires axis-4 proposalization, deferred). The `.coderabbit.yaml` exclusion for `.totem/compiled-rules.json` landed in the first commit so bot review focuses on the meaningful change surface.

    **Empirical bonus** from smoke-testing the subcommand: it surfaced 1 pre-existing absolute-promise match in `docs/wiki/governing-ai-agents.md:58`. The gate is already doing useful work. Addressing or accepting the finding is out of scope for PR α; surfacing it is the load-bearing demonstration.

    **Tests:** 23 new tests (6 schema, 13 subcommand, 4 hook content); full suite 2192/2192 passing.

    **Out of scope (PR β):** Rule 2 (marketing-absolutes — direct + retro-lesson), Rules 3-5 (missing-Goal-prefix, falsifying-metric on ADRs, covenant-without-backing — all lesson→compile per the hybrid criterion), four-week calibration window start, false-positive shavings against the empirical N=5 corpus, ast/ast-grep engine dispatch in the scanner.

## Action Summary

EcoTrace is a Python library designed for real-time carbon footprint measurement and management, offering granular tracking at the function level without requiring complex configurations or background services. It automates tasks such as carbon budget enforcement, CI/CD gating for emissions compliance, and differential tracking to isolate your code's energy impact. With features like real-time monitoring, session summaries, and AI-powered insights, EcoTrace helps developers and teams ensure environmental accountability in their software workflows.

## What's Changed

Summary

v1.1.0 brings EcoTrace into the enterprise observability ecosystem. This release focuses on two production-grade integrations that allow organizations to route carbon metrics directly into their existing monitoring infrastructure and track emissions from their full Django and Celery application stack.

---

New Features

1. OpenTelemetry (OTel) Exporter

EcoTrace can now push carbon metrics directly into any OpenTelemetry-compatible observability platform — Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus.

from ecotrace import EcoTrace
from ecotrace.exporters import OTelExporter

eco = EcoTrace(region_code="DE")
OTelExporter(ecotrace_instance=eco)  # auto-registers

A counter metric named `ecotrace.carbon.emitted` (unit: `g`) is created with two attributes per measurement:

- `ecotrace.function` — the name of the tracked function or block
- `ecotrace.region` — the grid intensity region code

Exporter dispatch is fully non-blocking: measurements are submitted to a 2-worker ThreadPoolExecutor so no slow telemetry backend can delay user code.

Install: `pip install ecotrace[otel]`

---

2. Django Middleware

Full WSGI and ASGI support for tracking carbon per HTTP request in Django applications.

# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "ecotrace.middleware.django.EcoTraceMiddleware",
    ...
]

# Optional settings
ECOTRACE_LOG_CSV = True   # log each request to ecotrace_log.csv

Every response receives two injected headers:
- `X-Eco-Carbon-Emitted` — carbon footprint in gCO2
- `X-Eco-Duration` — request duration in seconds

The middleware never interferes with 4xx/5xx responses — exceptions propagate naturally.

Install: `pip install ecotrace[web]`

---

3. Celery Plugin

Track carbon emissions per background task with automatic signal integration.

from ecotrace import EcoTrace
from ecotrace.plugins.celery import EcoTraceCelery

eco = EcoTrace(region_code="US")
EcoTraceCelery(ecotrace_instance=eco, log_to_csv=True)

Connects to four Celery worker signals:

| Signal | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| task_prerun | Start CPU monitor, stamp start time |
| task_postrun | Finalize measurement, log emissions |
| task_retry | Finalize current attempt independently (prevents double-counting) |
| task_revoked | Clean up state on kill/revoke (prevents memory leak) |

Install: `pip install ecotrace[celery]`

---

Core Engine Changes

- `EcoTrace.add_exporter(exporter)` — New public API to register any object implementing `.export(carbon_emitted, func_name, duration, region)`.
- Thread-safe exporter dispatch — Exporters run on a dedicated 2-worker ThreadPoolExecutor to prevent blocking.
- Graceful shutdown — `_exporter_pool.shutdown(wait=True)` is called on process exit to flush all in-flight export tasks before the process terminates.

---

Installation

# Core only
pip install ecotrace==1.1.0

# With OTel support
pip install "ecotrace[otel]==1.1.0"

# With Django + Celery
pip install "ecotrace[web,celery]==1.1.0"

# Everything
pip install "ecotrace[all]==1.1.0"

Bug Fixes

- Fixed GPU TDP resolution to use `nvmlDeviceGetPowerManagementLimit` (runtime limit) instead of `nvmlDeviceGetPowerManagementDefaultLimit` (factory cap), which caused over-estimation on power-capped GPUs (e.g. throttled data centre A100s).

---

What's Next — v1.2.0

- Sampling Mode — `@eco.track(sample_rate=0.1)` for statistical measurement at high call frequencies, removing the overhead barrier for adoption in high-throughput production services.

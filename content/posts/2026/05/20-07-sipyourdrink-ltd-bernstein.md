Version updated for **https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein** to version **v2.3.1**.

- This action is used across all versions by **5** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/bernstein-multi-agent-orchestration) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

Bernstein is a deterministic Python-based orchestration tool that schedules and manages multiple CLI coding agents to work in parallel towards a shared goal, utilizing git worktrees. It automates multi-agent workflows with robust compliance features, including an HMAC-signed audit chain, tamper-evident logging, and task authentication mechanisms. Designed for regulated environments, it ensures accountability and transparency for teams requiring detailed execution and audit trails.

## What's Changed

# v2.3.1 - Maintenance

4 commits since v2.3.0. No new features, no breaking changes. Patch release covering correctness fixes, CI hardening, and follow-up on review-bot findings deferred during the v2.3.0 cycle.

## Highlights

- Restore numeric and key coercions that the FURB123 auto-fix pass removed, plus 19 mechanical fixes from the 2026-05-19 review-bot catch-up.
- Soft-fail the cross-repo landing-mirror dispatch on PAT scope errors so the docs-drift pipeline keeps moving when the fine-grained PAT lacks `actions:write` on the landing repo.
- Harden the CLI against malformed `GLITCHTIP_DSN` and snapshot sidecars that fail schema validation.
- Map `UrlSchemeError` to the documented typed errors in MCP transports and the lineage-alert sink.

## New features

None.

## Fixes

- **Refurb correctness fixup** (#1615). Restored `int()` / `float()` / `str()` coercions and added explicit `isinstance` guards that the FURB refactor pass dropped. Eight bot-ack findings on the same PR addressed.
- **Landing-dispatch PAT scope** (#1617). Capture the HTTP status from the cross-repo `workflow_dispatch` call and emit an operator-actionable warning annotation when the dispatch endpoint rejects the request. The job now exits 0 in all non-success cases instead of failing the `trigger-landing-mirror` job and blocking the docs-drift pipeline on main.
- **GLITCHTIP_DSN crash on import** (#1618). Wrap `sentry_sdk.init` in a best-effort try/except so a malformed DSN cannot crash the CLI on import.
- **Snapshot-sidecar schema errors** (#1618). Treat schema-invalid snapshot sidecars as unreadable metadata (return None and warn) instead of raising `KeyError` / `TypeError` / `ValueError` through `SnapshotStore.get` / `list`. Reject negative `--days` for `bernstein git gc` before constructing the store and before computing the cutoff.
- **MCP transport typed-error surface** (#1618). Wrap `UrlSchemeError` from `ensure_http_url` as `TransportError` in `SseTransport.connect` and `StreamableHttpTransport.connect`. Catch `UrlSchemeError` in `sink_from_config` and fall back to `NullAlertSink`, preserving the "orchestrator never raises here" contract.
- **GitHub Projects adapter robustness** (#1618). Catch `OSError` around GitHub App private-key reads and raise `TrackerUnavailable` so the typed error surface stays intact. In `_item_to_ticket`, skip items whose `content.__typename` is not Issue / PullRequest / DraftIssue rather than emitting tickets with empty title / body / content-ids. Added regression test for the HTTP 403 abuse-detection -> `RateLimited` mapping.
- **Bundle command input validation** (#1618). Validate sign inputs as a pair and read the private key before assembling the bundle, so invalid CLI input never mutates on-disk state.
- **Docs cleanups** (#1618). Clarify the literal closing-fence string in the failure-taxonomy consumer-contract step. Prune scope reads as two distinct scopes in session-memory docs (episodic = session, semantic = task). Add `text` language tag to the post-CI-dispatcher sequence-diagram fence so markdownlint MD040 passes. Replace classic PAT scope strings with the fine-grained PAT permission model in the github-projects tracker doc.

## Internal

- **Refurb auto-fix wave 3** (#1615). Mechanical code-quality cleanup of remaining refurb findings across `src/` and `tests/`. Rules auto-fixed: FURB123 (redundant cast removal, 147 sites via custom line-based rewriter), FURB138 (assign-empty-list + append loop -> list comprehension, 57 sites via libcst rewriter restricted to single-statement bodies with `ast.parse` round-trip per file), FURB113 (repeated append -> `list.extend`, 5 leftovers via `ruff check --select FURB113 --preview --unsafe-fixes --fix`). Counts: FURB123 148 -> 0, FURB138 106 -> 49, FURB113 31 -> 26. Reformatted by `ruff format` (3 files). Wave 3 of the bulk auto-fix work started in #1558 and continued in #1582. Skipped this round: FURB184 (2440 sites, still needs whole-function liveness analysis), FURB138 leftovers (49 sites with multi-statement bodies, guarded branches, or appends with `continue` / `break`), FURB108 (24 sites), FURB173 (2 sites).
- **Sonar-scan timeout and uv caching** (#1616). Sonar scans were dying at the 20-minute job timeout during `uv sync --group dev` + `pytest --cov` on a 127-commit history. Raise the job-level budget to 60 minutes with per-step timeouts that fail fast on individual stages (sync 15m, coverage 30m, scan 10m). Pin the new `astral-sh/setup-uv` action to v8.1.0 with cache enabled so subsequent runs reuse the dev environment.
- **GlitchTip setup doc** (#1616). Added `docs/operations/glitchtip-setup.md` covering DSN provisioning, env-var export, and end-to-end event verification on a single page.
- **SBOM scope** (#1618). Generate the SBOM from an isolated venv where only the project and its resolved dependencies are installed, so the output reflects bernstein's dependency graph rather than the runner base image.
- **Review-bot triage continuity** (#1618). PR #1584 inventoried 48 review-bot findings and landed 4 mechanical fixes. This release picks up the remaining 44: 19 applied here, 14 already resolved on source PR branches before merge (CodeRabbit confirmed "Addressed in commits ..."), and 11 deferred for design judgement (config-schema changes, frozen-dataclass migrations, semantic-prune scope, stack indexing rework, worktree-aware git-dir resolution). Deferred items are tracked in `docs/review-bot/deferred-2026-05-19.md` so they are not lost.
- **Test typing and assertions** (#1618). Annotated the `sarif_module` fixture return type as `Generator[ModuleType, None, None]` in `tests/unit/scripts/test_sarif_drop_suppressed.py`. Explicit assertion message when `EXPECTED_CHILD_SECRETS` is missing an entry for a child in `tests/unit/test_post_ci_dispatcher_yaml.py`. Parse the GraphQL request body as JSON and assert against `variables` rather than byte-substring against raw `request.content` in the github-projects adapter tests.

## Deprecations

None.

## Upgrade notes

- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.0. No config-schema changes, no API changes, no audit-chain changes.
- Operators relying on the cross-repo `trigger-landing-mirror` job should verify the fine-grained PAT has `actions:write` on the landing repo. If the scope is missing, the job will now emit a warning annotation instead of failing the workflow.
- Operators using `bernstein git gc --days <N>` should note that negative `<N>` is now rejected up front rather than mishandled inside `SnapshotStore`.
- Operators using the GitHub App private-key path for the GitHub Projects tracker adapter will now see `TrackerUnavailable` on filesystem errors instead of a raw `OSError`.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the operators and reviewers who triaged the 2026-05-19 review-bot batch and to the CodeRabbit / Sourcery automation surface that surfaced the underlying findings.

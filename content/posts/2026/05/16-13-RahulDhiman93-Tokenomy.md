## Action Summary

Tokenomy is a GitHub Action and toolkit designed to optimize token usage in AI agent sessions by reducing unnecessary computational and memory overhead. It automates tasks such as live trimming of oversized responses, deduplication of repeated calls, compression of agent memory files, and redirecting wasteful processes, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Additionally, it provides observability tools for analyzing token savings and benchmarking historical inefficiencies in agent workflows.

## What's Changed

# Tokenomy v0.1.9 — Graph staleness, fixed at the core

Users reported the code graph being **"constantly marked stale mid-session"** — to the point that agents stopped trusting the freshness signal and fell back to broad `Read` sweeps, defeating the point of the graph MCP. 0.1.9 is a focused, core-level pass on that problem: five architectural fixes plus 29 rounds of Codex review (0 P0 / 1 P1 / ~47 P2-P3 findings, all resolved).

## TL;DR

- `stale: true` no longer fires for unrelated edits. Read responses now carry a precise `stale_in_scope` list — the subset of edited files that intersect this query's reachable surface.
- `whole_graph_stale: true` distinguishes config-level invalidations (tsconfig/exclude flip) from ordinary drift.
- An in-process **rebuild worker** watches `.dirty` with `fs.watch` + 150 ms debounce and rebuilds before the next query needs it. Reads observe lag instead of driving rebuilds.
- A mid-build edit can no longer be silently swallowed — `postBuildSuccess` snapshots the sentinel's `inode + mtime + size` at lock acquisition and only clears `.dirty` when those match.
- Statusline + tool responses now share the same truth source. No more "badge says fresh, response says stale."
- `tokenomy report` and `tokenomy analyze` gain a **Graph freshness** block with rebuild count, latency, and scoped-stale hit/miss ratio.

## Highlights

### Query-scoped staleness

Every cacheable graph tool (`find_usages`, `get_impact_radius`, `get_minimal_context`, `get_review_context`) now emits four staleness fields:

| field | semantics |
|---|---|
| `stale_files` | whole-graph drift list (sentinel + TTL-cached mtime/added-file walk) |
| `stale_in_scope` | subset of `stale_files` that intersects this query's reachable surface |
| `whole_graph_stale` | set when an exclude/tsconfig/`.tokenomy.json` change invalidates every query |
| `lag_ms` | wall-clock age of the oldest unconsumed dirty signal (never cached) |

`stale: true` stays **conservative** (true whenever any drift exists), because the scoped surface is built from the OLD snapshot and a new edit can introduce edges the snapshot can't show. Callers compare:

```ts
if (result.stale_in_scope?.length === 0
    && !result.whole_graph_stale
    && result.stale) {
  // drift exists but is likely unrelated to this answer — proceed at low risk
}
```

### In-process rebuild worker

The MCP server (`tokenomy graph serve`) now spawns a per-repo `fs.watch` + debounce loop:

1. Agent calls `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` / `NotebookEdit`
2. PostToolUse hook anchors the edited path against `input.cwd` and appends to `<graphDir>/.dirty`
3. `fs.watch` fires; worker debounces 150 ms and runs `buildGraph`
4. Next MCP read sees `stale: true` + `lag_ms` while the rebuild is in flight, OR a freshly rebuilt graph

Reads no longer drive rebuilds — they observe lag. Cross-platform (POSIX absolute, Windows `C:\…`, `./prefix`, backslash separators all collapse to forward-slash repo-relative). Cleanly opt-out for hostile filesystems:

```bash
tokenomy config set graph.rebuild_worker.enabled false
```

The worker also auto-disables when `graph.async_rebuild: false` (the documented synchronous-rebuild opt-out — users typically set it when they need build failures like `repo-too-large` to surface on the call that triggered drift).

### Sentinel race guard

`buildGraph` snapshots the dirty sentinel's `inode + size + mtime` at lock acquisition. `postBuildSuccess` clears `.dirty` only when all three match — any mid-build edit leaves the signal for the next cycle. Build results call `reflectPostBuildSentinel`, so a synchronous rebuild that left `.dirty` returns `stale: true` instead of misleading callers into thinking the graph is current.

### Statusline alignment

Pre-0.1.9 the badge used a 24-hour `built_at` heuristic, divorced from the MCP read path. Now it reads the same `.dirty` sentinel + meta validity that the read path uses, so:

```
[Tokenomy v0.1.9 · 4.2k saved · graph stale - rebuild]
```

…and the tool response's `stale` flag never disagree.

### Graph freshness in report + analyze

```
Graph freshness
  worker:            active
  rebuilds:          14   last: 132ms   avg: 156ms
  last rebuild:      2026-05-16T14:23:45.123Z
  dirty pending:     0 file(s)
  scoped stale:      8 hit / 47 miss  (15% of drift actually relevant)
```

The hit/miss ratio quantifies the win — "X% of drift was actually relevant to a query." Counters live in `<repoRoot>/.tokenomy-graph/.rebuild-stats.json`.

## Codex review pass (29 rounds, all green)

| severity | count | examples |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | 0 | — |
| P1 | 1 | worker retry loop bounded to `build-in-progress` with 3-attempt cap |
| P2 | ~35 | sentinel race, cache key collisions, server-mode worker gate, cross-platform path normalization, exclude/tsconfig fingerprint preservation, added-file detection, in-flight build coalescing, runtime config opt-out, storage-location flip, budget-clip protection |
| P3 | ~12 | scoped-stale doc precision, hotspot surface bounds, malformed-meta validation |

Round-by-round notes are inlined as code comments (`codex round N P[1-3]`) for future debugging context.

## Migration

**No schema bump. No breaking changes.**

- `stale_in_scope`, `whole_graph_stale`, and `lag_ms` are additive optional fields on `Ok<T>`. Existing consumers that read only `stale` and `stale_files` continue to work.
- `graph.rebuild_worker: { enabled: true, debounce_ms: 150 }` is the new default. Existing `.tokenomy.json` files inherit it from `DEFAULT_CONFIG`.
- `.rebuild-stats.json` is created on first worker registration or first `recordScopedStaleSample` call; absent file = zeros.
- Statusline and read-path use the same staleness check, so the badge may now flip to "stale" sooner than the old 24h heuristic would have. This is expected — it reflects what the agent actually sees.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g tokenomy@0.1.9
tokenomy update
```

In every repo where you've registered the graph:

```bash
tokenomy init --graph-path "$PWD"
```

## Action Summary

Totem is a file-based toolkit designed to enhance collaboration with AI coding agents by maintaining architectural context and enforcing code quality. It addresses issues such as agents forgetting project context, reinventing existing solutions, and degrading architectural integrity by providing a queryable knowledge index, markdown-based lessons, and a deterministic lint engine to enforce coding rules. Totem automates context sharing, integrates with AI tools, and ensures compliance with architectural guidelines, improving productivity and reducing friction in AI-assisted development workflows.

## What's Changed

### Minor Changes

-   c0f0cfc: feat(cli+core): `totem mail` cross-repo outbox poll subcommand (mmnto-ai/totem#1970)

    Closes [mmnto-ai/totem#1970](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem/issues/1970). Option B locked per [ADR-107](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/blob/main/adr/adr-107-ecl-canonical-over-a2a.md) (Ephemeral Coordination Layer canonical; no network-RPC alternative adopted).

    New `totem mail` subcommand surfaces unread mail addressed to this repo's agent(s) by scanning sibling-repo outboxes per [ADR-106 § 3](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/blob/main/adr/adr-106-ephemeral-coordination-layer.md). Provides the first canonical implementation of the spec so consumer repos (`totem`, `liquid-city`, `arhgap11`, `totem-status`, etc.) pick the poll up via cohort sync rather than each maintaining its own copy. Before this, only `mmnto-ai/totem-strategy` had a working poll (the reference impl in its SessionStart hook); other cohort repos had no implementation at all.

    Empirically motivated: two outbound handoffs from `strategy-claude` (`2026-05-18T1734Z` → `totem-claude`; `2026-05-18T1918Z` → `lc-claude`) sat undelivered for ~30-36h despite valid `to:` frontmatter because [ADR-106 § 3](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/blob/main/adr/adr-106-ephemeral-coordination-layer.md) specified the cross-repo outbox-poll mechanism but no recipient repo's hook implemented it. The strategy-side reference implementation ([`mmnto-ai/totem-strategy#373`](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/pull/373), merged at `ea0ee6d`) validated the behavior contract; this PR is the canonical port.

    ## Surfaces

    -   **`packages/core/src/orchestration-resolver.ts`** — new `resolveSelfAgents(repoRoot, env?)` helper with the cohort agent-id map plus a 3-layer precedence chain (`TOTEM_SELF_AGENT` env > `.totem/orchestration/config.json` `host_agents` > basename map > `[]`). Mirrors `resolveOrchestrationPaths`'s path-traversal guard so a malicious or buggy `host_agents` entry drops at the validation boundary instead of escaping `.totem/orchestration/`.
    -   **`packages/cli/src/commands/mail.ts`** — `pollMail()` programmatic entry returning a structured `MailPollResult` plus `mailCommand()` CLI wrapper. Reusable by hooks (JSON output), MCP audit tools, and future surfaces.
    -   **`packages/cli/src/index.ts`** — `totem mail [--json] [--recursive] [--workspace <path>]` registration alongside the existing administrative subcommands.

    ## Behavior contract (locked per ADR-107 § Consequences)

    -   **Match**: case-insensitive on `to:` frontmatter value against the SELF_AGENT set or literal `broadcast`. Required for back-compat with the existing `to: arhgap11-Gemini` capitalization in an outbox file.
    -   **Exclude**: files whose basename appears in any SELF_AGENT's `processed/` or `processed/_broadcast/` directory.
    -   **Workspace**: parent directory of `repoRoot` by default; `TOTEM_WORKSPACE` env var or `--workspace` flag override.
    -   **Recursive**: opt-in via `--recursive` flag. The default scans `<workspace>/*/.totem/orchestration/*/outbox/*.md`; recursive descends up to 6 levels skipping dot-dirs and `node_modules`.
    -   **Latency cap**: `MAX_SCAN=500` files scanned per invocation. When tripped, result carries `truncated: true` so the caller can surface the warning instead of silently dropping mail.
    -   **Sort**: newest-first by frontmatter `date:` with filename fallback.
    -   **Frontmatter safety**: only the header block (text before the first blank line) is parsed for `to:` / `from:` / `subject:` / `date:`. Body lines starting with `to:` cannot fabricate a match or overwrite displayed metadata.
    -   **Failure stance**: never throws on filesystem failure; degrades to warnings on the result so a degraded workspace state does not block the poll.

    ## Tests

    -   23 new resolver tests cover the basename map for every cohort repo, `host_agents` override precedence, `TOTEM_SELF_AGENT` env precedence, comma-separated list parsing, path-traversal rejection at every layer, malformed JSON tolerance, and `path.resolve` normalization on relative inputs.
    -   29 new mail-command tests cover basic filter behavior, broadcast handling, processed/ + processed/\_broadcast/ exclusion, multi-agent repo behavior, newest-first sort, CRLF line endings, frontmatter-header restriction (body forge attempt), workspace + recursive options, `node_modules` skip, and `MAX_SCAN` truncation.
    -   Smoke-tested against the live cohort workspace: surfaces the three handoffs currently addressed to `totem-claude` in `mmnto-ai/totem-strategy:.totem/orchestration/strategy-claude/outbox/`.

    ## SELF_AGENT resolution rationale (`mmnto-ai/totem#1970` Q1)

    The signoff skill at `.claude/skills/signoff/SKILL.md` already names the resolution mechanism in prose (basename → agent-id table + `.totem/orchestration/config.json` `host_agents` override). Encoding that prose into a reusable helper rather than re-deriving in each consumer is the path Tenet 15 (Axiom Mandate) implies: encode as mechanism, not prose. The env-var precedence is the hook surface — hooks set `TOTEM_SELF_AGENT` to declare identity when running inside a CI/test/visiting context where the basename heuristic does not apply.

    ## Consumer migration (not in this PR)

    Once this lands and cohort-propagates, the strategy-side `pollInboundOutboxes` reference impl in [`mmnto-ai/totem-strategy:.claude/hooks/SessionStart.cjs`](https://github.com/mmnto-ai/totem-strategy/blob/main/.claude/hooks/SessionStart.cjs) is superseded — each consumer's hook can `exec totem mail --json` and inject the structured result. Per-vendor handling stays in the hooks themselves; the poll body is identical. Strategy-Claude has flagged the consumer-side cutover for cohort-sync after this ships.

Version updated for **https://github.com/OpenSource-For-Freedom/Legion_runner** to version **v1.0.16**.

- This action is used across all versions by **1** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Node** action using Node version **24**.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/legion-harden-runner) to find the latest changes.

## What's Changed

### Added
- **File-integrity / tamper detection (Rust `legionr-fim` agent)**: snapshots
  high-value tamper targets at job start (credential/config files, `.git`
  config + hooks, and checked-out source) and diffs them at job end, surfacing
  anything overwritten, deleted, or chmod'd in the summary. Only sha256 hashes
  are stored — never contents. New inputs `file-integrity` (auto|off) and
  `fim-extra-paths`. `file-integrity: auto` downloads the agent from the latest
  release (plain stable Rust, no eBPF toolchain) and degrades to a silent skip
  if unavailable. Logic lives in `legionr-core::fim` (unit-tested); the binary
  is a release asset like `legionr-bpf`, built + attached by `release.yml`.

### Changed
- **Name more destinations**: route glibc `getaddrinfo` (curl/apt/cargo/git)
  through the DNS-capture forwarder via an `nsswitch.conf` reroute, so hosts
  resolved by systemd-resolved (which ignores `resolv.conf`) are now captured
  and named — not just `resolv.conf`/c-ares callers. Health-checked and restored
  on teardown. (A connection to a hard-coded IP with no PTR still shows the IP —
  there is no name to resolve.)
- More accurate "unresolved destination" note in the summary (a name may have
  been resolved outside the capture path, vs. a genuine raw-IP connection).

## What's Changed

# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-15

Supply-chain hardening for the scanner image and signed, verifiable releases
(closes #30).

### Added
- Pinned every bundled binary scanner to an exact version with SHA256 checksum
  verification in the Docker image — gitleaks, zizmor, actionlint, poutine,
  osv-scanner, trivy (#31)
- Hash-locked the pip-installed scanners (semgrep, checkov, zizmor) via a fully
  pinned, multi-arch `requirements-scanners.txt` installed with
  `pip --require-hashes` (#33)
- Renovate configuration to auto-PR scanner version bumps, with a CI job that
  refreshes the pinned checksums (#32)
- Keyless (OIDC) cosign signing of the published container image and of the
  release binary checksums (Sigstore bundle `checksums.txt.sigstore.json`) (#34)
- SBOM (SPDX) attached to every release and as an image attestation (#34)
- Max-mode SLSA build provenance attestation on the container image (#34)
- "Verifying releases" instructions in the README (#34)

### Changed
- Pinned checkov to 3.2.531 (from 3.3.1) so its dependency tree resolves the
  patched aiohttp 3.14.1 and drops the unfixable python-ecdsa Minerva
  dependency that checkov 3.3.x introduced. Revisit when a newer checkov lifts
  its `aiohttp<3.14` cap (#33)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- 8 security scanners: gitleaks, zizmor, actionlint, poutine,
  semgrep, osv-scanner, trivy, checkov
- Unified Finding schema with fingerprinting
- Three output formats: SARIF 2.1.0, JSON, GitHub PR comment
- GitHub Action with outputs
- Config-driven scanner behavior via muninn.yml
- Suppression management with expiry dates
- 90%+ test coverage enforced in CI
- Integration tests with real scanner binaries
- Self-scan: Muninn scans itself on every PR

## Action Summary

Hwaro is a lightweight and high-performance static site generator written in Crystal that transforms Markdown content with front matter and Jinja2-compatible templates into fully built static websites. It automates tasks like parallel builds, incremental caching, SEO optimization, and deployment configuration for platforms such as GitHub Pages. Key features include advanced content management, customizable templates, built-in development tools (live reload, dev server), and support for modern web functionalities like PWA, AMP, and responsive image processing.

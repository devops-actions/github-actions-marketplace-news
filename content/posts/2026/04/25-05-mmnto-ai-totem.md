## Action Summary

Totem is a CLI tool designed to provide a persistent memory and enforcement layer for AI coding agents, ensuring architectural integrity across repositories. It automates the process of converting plain-English lessons about coding mistakes into enforceable linting rules, which are applied locally and offline to prevent recurring errors during development workflows. By acting as a "tripwire," Totem addresses challenges like context loss and redundant mistakes, enhancing collaboration between AI agents and human developers without relying on runtime large language models (LLMs).

## What's Changed

### Patch Changes

-   d295439: 1.15.4 bundles two compile-worker prompt classifier improvements that surfaced from downstream consumer friction on `mmnto-ai/liquid-city`. Both close fidelity gaps between the lesson prose authors wrote and the compiled rule that shipped.

    ## Test-contract scope classifier (closes #1626)

    -   New `### Test-Contract Scope Classifier (mmnto-ai/totem#1626)` section on both `COMPILER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `PIPELINE3_COMPILER_PROMPT`. Teaches the compile-worker to recognize lessons whose hazard is **behavior inside test files** (assertion conventions, spy / mock contracts, test-fixture hygiene) and emit test-inclusive `fileGlobs` instead of the default `!**/*.test.*` exclusion.
    -   Three positive signals classify a lesson as test-contract: the `testing` tag, test-framework calls in `badExample`/`goodExample` (`describe(`, `it(`, `test(`, `expect(`, `vi.mock(`, `jest.mock(`, `beforeEach(`, `afterEach(`, `vi.spyOn(`, `jest.spyOn(`), or lesson-body references to test-execution-specific behavior.
    -   Broad test-inclusive glob set for test-contract rules: `["**/*.test.*", "**/*.spec.*", "**/tests/**/*.*", "**/__tests__/**/*.*"]`. Narrow test-scoped globs (e.g., `packages/e2e/**/*.spec.ts`) are preserved when the lesson clearly targets them.
    -   False-positive trap guard: the word "contract" alone does NOT classify a lesson as test-scoped. Lessons titled "Define strict API Data Contracts" or "Versioning contracts for REST endpoints" describe application-surface invariants. Classification requires the `testing` tag OR test-framework code in the examples alongside any keyword match.

    **Downstream impact:** Two `liquid-city` rules (`"Normalize temp paths for cross-platform equality"`, `"Spy on logger contracts in tests"`) were shipping with scopes that excluded tests and silently never fired. A follow-up chore cycle (`totem compile --upgrade <hash>` per rule) retriages existing corpus against the new prompt.

    ## Declared severity override (closes #1656)

    -   New `parseDeclaredSeverity(body: string)` helper exported from `@mmnto/totem`. Parses `**Severity:** error` / `Severity: warning` prose declarations from a lesson body and returns a normalized `'error' | 'warning' | undefined`. Tolerates common markdown and punctuation shapes: bold markers (`**`, `*`, `_`) on either side, backtick-wrapped values, trailing sentence punctuation (`.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!`, `?`), and combined shapes like `**Severity: error**.`. Strict enum equality follows the strip, so out-of-vocabulary tokens (`info`, `critical`) return `undefined`.
    -   `buildCompiledRule` honors a new `declaredSeverityOverride` option on `BuildCompiledRuleOptions`. Post-LLM override wins over `parsed.severity` regardless of LLM emission. Marker fires in `BuildRuleResult.severityOverride` only when the override actually changed the outcome (declared value differs from `emittedSeverity ?? 'warning'`). Marker is threaded through rejection paths too, so telemetry captures prompt-drift even when the rule fails for other reasons.
    -   New `onSeverityOverride` callback on `CompileLessonCallbacks` fires when the override changes the emitted severity. CLI `compile.ts` wires a `writeSeverityOverrideTelemetry` closure that appends records tagged `type: 'severity-override'` to `.totem/temp/telemetry.jsonl` via the cwd-aware `totemDir` (matches the `mmnto-ai/totem#1645` pattern). Fire-and-forget; sink failures do not interfere with compile results.
    -   New `### Declared Severity (mmnto-ai/totem#1656)` directive section on both compile prompts instructs the LLM to honor prose-declared severity in its emitted JSON. Every Output Schema example and every concrete Lesson → Output few-shot example now carries `"severity": "warning"` (the default) to reduce drift at source.

    **Downstream impact:** Five `liquid-city` ADR-008 rules on PR 77 burned ~10 manual severity-edit commits across R2 + R3 rounds because the compile pipeline emitted `"severity": "warning"` despite lesson prose declaring `Severity: error`. The mechanical re-edit loop closes; the next `totem lesson compile` cycle on LC emits declared severity directly.

    ## Strategy submodule bump

    -   `.strategy` submodule pointer advances from `113179c` to `7892892b`. Picks up strategy PR #125 (upstream-feedback items 015 + 016 from liquid-city session-17) and strategy PR #124 (upstream-feedback item 017 — three-layer language support gap addendum that documents the architectural surface of the pending Rust-support arc).

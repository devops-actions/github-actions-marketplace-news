## Action Summary

**Totem** is a CLI tool designed to provide a persistent memory and enforcement layer for AI coding agents. It automates the process of capturing and enforcing lessons learned from architectural mistakes, PR reviews, or production bugs by converting them into deterministic, offline linting rules that prevent recurring errors. This helps maintain code quality, ensures consistency across repositories, and reduces the need for repetitive human intervention during code reviews.

## What's Changed

### Patch Changes

-   e96599e: Precision Engine: compound ast-grep rules + compile-time smoke gate

    The 1.14.9 release closes the rule-quality loop before Pack Distribution opens. Compiled rules can now express structural context ("inside a loop", "outside an import"), and every Pipeline 2 / Pipeline 3 rule must demonstrably match its own `badExample` snippet before it lands in `compiled-rules.json`. Defense-in-Depth Layer 2: the schema rejects malformed shapes at parse time; the smoke gate rejects semantically-broken rules at compile time.

    **Compound ast-grep rules (#1410, #1412):**

    -   New `astGrepYamlRule` field on `CompiledRule` carries full `NapiConfig`-shape compound rules with `inside`, `has`, and `not` combinators. Mutually exclusive with the flat `astGrepPattern` field via Zod `superRefine`.
    -   New `canonicalStringify` utility in `compile-manifest.ts` produces key-order-deterministic hashes so compound rules with semantically-identical shapes but different LLM key orders cannot trip `verify-manifest`. Backward-compat guard: pre-1.14.9 manifests without compound rules hash byte-for-byte to the same value as before, so existing installs do not need a forced recompile.
    -   Spike harness committed under `packages/core/spikes/compound-ast-grep/` with 9 tests pinning the empirically-validated behaviors of `@ast-grep/napi@0.42.0`, including the sharp edge that `inside: { pattern: 'for ($A; $B; $C) { $$$ }' }` silently matches zero (use `inside: { kind: 'for_statement' }` instead).

    **Engine runtime + compile-time smoke gate (#1415):**

    -   `applyAstRulesToAdditions` widened to dispatch on either `astGrepPattern` (string) or `astGrepYamlRule` (object), with per-rule try/catch in `executeQuery` so one malformed rule cannot crash a whole file's lint pass.
    -   New `'failure'` event variant on `RuleEventCallback`, semantically distinct from `'suppress'` (suppression is reserved for user-initiated `totem-ignore` directives). Failure context carries `failureReason` for `totem doctor` aggregation.
    -   New `compile-smoke-gate.ts` module exports `runSmokeGate(rule, badExample)`. Reuses the runtime engine entry points (`matchAstGrepPattern`, `new RegExp`) so a rule passing the gate cannot silently fail to match at runtime on identical input. Multi-extension iteration so rules scoped to both `.js` and `.jsx` (which map to different parsers) match under whichever parser the snippet needs.

    **Compiler prompt + `badExample` requirement (#1420):**

    -   Pipeline 2 and Pipeline 3 compiler prompts rewritten to teach Sonnet compound rule emission with `kind:` for outer combinator targets. Three compound examples (inside-a-for-loop, has-shell-true, JSON.parse-not-in-try) each carrying their own `badExample`.
    -   New `KIND_ALLOW_LIST` named export from `compile-templates.ts`. 15 tree-sitter kinds covering common outer-combinator surfaces (control flow, function and class declarations, imports/exports, if/switch). Reusable: `totem doctor` will lint existing compiled rules for illegal `kind:` targets in a future release.
    -   `CompilerOutputSchema.badExample` flipped from optional to required for `ast-grep` AND `regex` engines via `superRefine`. The `ast` (Tree-sitter) engine stays exempt because the smoke gate does not yet cover S-expression queries. Pipeline 1 (manual) gate enforcement is deferred to #1414 pending a 136-lesson Bad Example backfill.

    **Architectural impact:**

    Pipeline 2 compile throughput dropped to near zero between #1415 and #1420 because the gate started rejecting rules before the prompt had taught Sonnet to emit `badExample`. This was the gate working as designed: better zero rules than zero-match hallucinations distributed via packs. The prompt rewrite in #1420 reopens the throughput valve. Phase 4 of the epic (batch-recompile of 22+ archived rules tagged `upgradeTarget: compound`) unblocks once the new prompt is exercised against the queue.

    **Test counts:** 2879 passing across core (1134), CLI (1662), MCP (83). Net +93 from the 1.14.8 baseline of 2786.

    **Compiled rules:** 411 in the rules array (389 active, 22 archived). 889 nonCompilable entries in the sibling ledger (lessons the LLM declined to convert into rules).

    **Follow-ups (unmilestoned):** #1414 (Pipeline 1 backfill), #1418 (MCP stale-handle), #1419 (Trap Ledger crypto attestation for SOX). The pre-1.15.0 deep review gate (#1421) blocks 1.15.0 implementation until a four-surface independent pass on `main` clears.

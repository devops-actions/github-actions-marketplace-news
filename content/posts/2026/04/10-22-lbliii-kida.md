Version updated for **https://github.com/lbliii/kida** to version **v0.4.0**.

- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

## Action Summary

Kida is a versatile template engine that compiles to Python AST and renders content for multiple outputs, including HTML, terminal, markdown, and CI reports, while scaling efficiently across Python's free-threaded environments. It automates and streamlines the generation of dynamic content, such as test reports or user interfaces, by providing a unified syntax and built-in templates for popular tools like pytest and coverage. Its key capabilities include template inheritance, reusable components, pattern matching, streaming, and integration with GitHub Actions for automating CI/CD workflows.

## What's Changed


# v0.4.0

**Released** 2026-04-10.

Kida 0.4.0 is the biggest feature release since the project's inception — list comprehensions,
error boundaries, i18n with Babel extraction, scoped slots, and a two-phase partial evaluator
that widens the compile-time optimization surface.

## Highlights

- **List comprehensions** — `[x.name for x in users if x.active]` works natively in template expressions.
- **Error boundaries** — `{% boundary %}` blocks catch render errors and fall back to safe defaults without aborting the whole page.
- **i18n `{% trans %}` blocks** — Full internationalization support with pluralization, variable interpolation, and Babel-compatible message extraction.
- **Scoped slots** — Components can expose data back to the caller via `{% slot name expose x, y %}`.
- **Two-phase partial evaluator** — Constant folding, dead branch elimination, and loop unrolling at compile time for measurable render speedups.

## Added

### Expressions

- **List comprehensions** — `[expr for var in iterable if condition]` with full parser, compiler,
  analysis (dependency tracking, purity), and CLI integration. (#62)

### Template Control Flow

- **Error boundaries** — `{% boundary %}...{% fallback %}...{% endboundary %}` catches exceptions
  during rendering and substitutes fallback content. Integrates with the environment's error handler. (#61)
- **Scoped slots** — `{% slot name expose x, y %}` lets parent components bind slot-exposed variables,
  enabling inversion-of-control patterns. (#61)

### Internationalization

- **`{% trans %}` / `{% pluralize %}` blocks** — Mark translatable strings with variable interpolation
  and plural forms. The compiler generates `gettext`/`ngettext` calls. (#61)
- **Babel extraction** — `kida.babel.extract` entry point lets `pybabel extract` pull translatable
  strings from Kida templates. (#63)
- **`kida i18n` CLI** — `kida i18n extract` and `kida i18n analyze` commands for standalone message
  extraction and translation coverage analysis. (#63)
- **Analysis integration** — i18n analysis module tracks translatable strings, detects missing
  translations, and integrates with the dependency and purity analyzers. (#63)

### Compiler

- **Partial evaluator phase 1** — Constant folding, filter inlining for pure built-in filters,
  dead branch elimination, and loop unrolling for small static iterables. Configurable via
  `Environment(partial_eval=True)` with per-strategy controls. (#64)
- **Partial evaluator phase 2** — Extends optimization to conditional expressions, nested structures,
  string operations, comprehension folding, and cross-block constant propagation. (#65)
- **`kida compile --optimize` CLI** — Inspect the optimized AST and see before/after comparisons. (#64, #65)

## Changed

- **Performance docs** — Updated to cover partial evaluation strategies and benchmarks. (#64)
- **Compiler docs** — New sections on the optimization pipeline and custom filter purity. (#64)
- **Configuration docs** — Documents `partial_eval` and related environment options. (#64)

## Upgrade Notes

1. No breaking changes. Drop-in upgrade from 0.3.4.
2. Partial evaluation is opt-in — enable with `Environment(partial_eval=True)`.
3. i18n requires no new dependencies; Babel integration is optional.
4. GitHub Action version tag updated to `@v0.4.0`.

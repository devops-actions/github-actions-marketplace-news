## Action Summary

Totem is a CLI tool designed to provide a persistent memory and enforcement layer for AI coding agents, addressing their tendency to forget architectural context and repeat mistakes. It automates the process of converting plain-English lessons into enforceable rules that catch and block repeated errors during development, ensuring architectural integrity and reducing friction in code reviews. Key capabilities include offline linting, deterministic rule enforcement, and a scalable mechanism to prevent recurring issues.

## What's Changed

### Minor Changes

-   9686817: ADR-091 Stage 4 Verify-Against-Codebase verifier (`mmnto-ai/totem#1682`). Headline 1.16.0 substrate. Before a compiled rule moves to Active status, it runs deterministically (zero LLM) against the consumer's working tree and is routed into one of four outcomes:

    -   **No matches** → `status: 'untested-against-codebase'`. Verifier ran, found no hits in this codebase. Subsequent compile cycles in a populated repo can re-run Stage 4 and promote.
    -   **Out-of-scope baseline match** → `status: 'archived'`, `archivedReason` cites the offending paths, new reasonCode `'stage4-out-of-scope-match'` added to `NonCompilableReasonCodeSchema`. Pattern is over-broad.
    -   **In-scope `badExample`-shape match** → new `confidence: 'high'` field set. Pattern fires on real code in the exact authored shape.
    -   **Candidate Debt** (in-scope but not bad-example shape) → force `severity: 'warning'` so the rule is alive but cannot break CI on first run; `totem doctor` (T4 / `mmnto-ai/totem#1685`) will surface the candidate-debt sites.

    T1 ships local-compile mode fully. The verifier walks the consumer's git-enumerated file set and reuses the existing `applyRulesToAdditions` / `applyAstRulesToAdditions` rule-engine surfaces; baseline glob matching mirrors the test-contract scope classifier shapes (`mmnto-ai/totem#1626` / `mmnto-ai/totem#1652`). Telemetry events tagged `type: 'stage4-verify'` append to `.totem/temp/telemetry.jsonl`.

    **Public API (new, exported from `@mmnto/totem`):** `verifyAgainstCodebase`, `getDefaultBaseline`, `DEFAULT_BASELINE_GLOBS`, type `Stage4VerificationResult`, type `Stage4Baseline`, type `Stage4Outcome`, type `Stage4VerifierDeps`. New optional `verifyStage4` callback on `CompileLessonDeps`; new optional `onStage4Outcome` callback on `CompileLessonCallbacks`. Schema deltas: `CompiledRuleSchema.status` enum gains `'untested-against-codebase'`, new optional `confidence` field, `NonCompilableReasonCodeSchema` gains `'stage4-out-of-scope-match'`.

    **Negative scope (deferred to follow-on tickets):** Pack install→lint promotion + `pending-verification` state writers + `.totem/rule-metrics.json` reads belong to T3 (`mmnto-ai/totem#1684`). Consumer `.totemignore` / `review.stage4Baseline` config field belongs to T2 (`mmnto-ai/totem#1683`). `totem doctor` Stage 4 surfaces belong to T4 (`mmnto-ai/totem#1685`). Batched / streamed perf optimizations belong to T5 (`mmnto-ai/totem#1686`). Pipeline 1 (manual) rules bypass Stage 4 — those are human-authored and self-evidencing.

    **Bot-review tail:** Sonnet pre-push review caught a defensive-coding gap on the candidate-debt severity downgrade (treating `undefined` severity as a no-op would let pre-1.16.0 persisted rules skip the downgrade if a future lint pass interpreted undefined as `'error'`). Tightened to `severity !== 'warning'` so the post-condition is explicit.

## Action Summary

Totem is a CLI tool that provides a persistent memory and enforcement layer for AI coding agents, ensuring architectural integrity and preventing repetitive mistakes. It automates the creation and enforcement of coding rules by converting plain-English lessons into deterministic linting rules, which are enforced offline to block undesired code patterns during development. This helps maintain consistency, reduces review overhead, and ensures AI agents adhere to best practices across projects.

## What's Changed

### Patch Changes

-   20c491c: fix(core+cli): honor source-declared `**Scope:**` over LLM emission on Pipeline 2/3 (#1665)

    Strategy item 023 substrate. Inverse of `mmnto-ai/totem#1626` (auto-ADD): the compile worker silently DROPPED test/spec exclusion globs (`!**/*.test.*`, `!**/*.spec.*`) that lessons declared in their `**Scope:**` line. Confirmed twice on `mmnto-ai/liquid-city#80` for rules `5bcc8aad9096c817` and `6c457c82d3945d15`.

    -   New `parseDeclaredScope(body)` helper in `@mmnto/totem` that parses the lesson body's `**Scope:**` prose declaration into a glob list. Preserves `!`-prefixed exclusion entries verbatim and preserves authored order. Returns `undefined` for missing/empty/whitespace-only declarations.
    -   New `isGlobSetEqual(a, b)` pure helper for set-of-strings comparison. Order-insensitive, duplicate-insensitive, sign-sensitive (`'!**/*.test.*'` does not equal `'**/*.test.*'`).
    -   `extractManualPattern` (Pipeline 1) refactored to delegate Scope parsing to `parseDeclaredScope` so the manual flow shares a single source of truth with Pipeline 2/3.
    -   `BuildCompiledRuleOptions.lessonBody?: string` opts callers into the override path. When supplied AND the body declares a `**Scope:**` line, the parsed source-Scope glob list takes precedence over `parsed.fileGlobs` regardless of LLM emission. Both lists pass through `sanitizeFileGlobs` for parity (shallow → recursive normalization).
    -   `BuildRuleResult.scopeOverride?: { from: string[] | undefined; to: string[] }` reports the override event when the override actually changed the emitted globs. Threaded through rejection paths too. Mirrors `severityOverride` discipline from #1656.
    -   New `onScopeOverride` callback on `CompileLessonCallbacks` wired to a `writeScopeOverrideTelemetry` closure in CLI `compile.ts` that records `type: 'scope-override'` entries to `.totem/temp/telemetry.jsonl`. Cloud-compile path also wired.
    -   Author intent supreme: source-declared Scope overrides the LLM's emission AND the #1626 test-contract auto-include heuristic. The auto-include path stays active only when the lesson omits Scope.

    Compile pipeline failure mode shifts from "silent drop" to "deterministic override + telemetry on divergence." Strict-fail compile gate is deferred to a follow-up if telemetry reveals persistent LLM drift.

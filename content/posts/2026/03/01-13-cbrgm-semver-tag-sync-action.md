## Action Summary

The `semver-tag-sync-action` is a GitHub Action designed to automatically synchronize major (`v1`) and minor (`v1.2`) version tags with semantic versioning releases (e.g., `v1.2.3`) in a repository. It simplifies version management by ensuring users can reference stable and predictable version tags without manual updates, addressing the need for consistent version-agnostic access to releases, especially for GitHub Action authors. Key capabilities include automatic tag updates, skipping prerelease versions, and support for cross-repository synchronization.

## Action Summary

The GitHub Action "agent-bom" is an advanced AI supply chain security scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities (CVEs) in packages and images while assessing the broader security impacts, such as credential exposure, tool accessibility, and privilege risks. It automates the mapping of vulnerabilities to their potential blast radius, including affected agents, exposed credentials, and tools, providing comprehensive risk assessments and enterprise-focused remediation strategies. Key capabilities include compliance with multiple frameworks (e.g., OWASP, MITRE, NIST), malicious package detection, and integration with OpenSSF Scorecards for package health insights.

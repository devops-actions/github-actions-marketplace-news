## Action Summary

The `combine-rss-feeds` GitHub Action automates the process of fetching entries from multiple RSS or Atom feeds, merging them into a single RSS 2.0 XML file, and sorting the entries by publication date (newest first). It simplifies feed aggregation by allowing users to customize entry limits per source and provides a consolidated, well-organized output for easy consumption. This action is a lightweight, dependency-free solution implemented in Go, making it efficient and easy to integrate into CI/CD workflows.

Version updated for **https://github.com/GhrammR/the-janitor** to version **v6.11.4**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/the-janitor-stop-the-slop) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The Janitor is a GitHub Action that acts as a structural firewall for AI-generated code, ensuring the integrity and security of code changes before they are merged. It automates the detection and removal of dead code, zombie dependencies, language antipatterns, and cryptographic integrity validation, addressing vulnerabilities often introduced by AI-assisted coding. With its zero-copy execution and precise analysis capabilities, it provides a robust enforcement layer to maintain clean, reliable, and secure codebases.

## Release notes

# The Janitor: Structural Firewall for AI-Generated Code
**v6.11.4 — Rust-Native. Zero-Copy. Enforcement at the Gate.**

> **Sonar finds style violations.**
> **The Janitor enforces structural integrity.**

> *82% of open Godot Engine pull requests contain no issue link. 20% introduce language antipatterns. Zero comment scanners caught it. The Janitor did — across 50 live PRs, in under 90 seconds.*

## The Problem

The Veracode 2025 State of Software Security report established the baseline: AI-assisted code contains **36% more high-severity vulnerabilities** than human-written equivalents. Your linter passes Copilot output. Your SAST tool uploads it to a cloud pipeline. By the time the report arrives, the PR is merged.

The threat model has changed. Your enforcement layer has not.

## Zero-Friction GitHub Integration

![Janitor Sentinel Demo](docs/assets/sentinel_demo.webp)

*Janitor Sentinel automatically downgrades vetoes when it detects safe patterns (e.g., Dependabot).*

## The Enforcement Layer

The Janitor is not a linter. It is a **structural firewall** that runs on your hardware, on every pull request — before the merge button is available.

### Zero-Copy Execution

Every analysis executes via **memory-mapped file access**. Source code is never copied to heap, never serialized, never transmitted. No network call is made during the dead-symbol pipeline.

**Benchmark:** 3.5 million lines of Godot Engine — **33 seconds, 58 MB peak RAM.** On a standard CI runner. Zero panics.

### Zombie Dependency Detection

AI generators hallucinate package imports. The Janitor scans `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `spin.toml`, and `wrangler.toml` against the live symbol reference graph. A package that appears in your manifest but never appears in a reachable import path is a zombie dependency — flagged before merge.

### Cryptographic Integrity Bonds

When a pull request clears the slop gate, **Janitor Sentinel** — our GitHub App — automatically issues a **CycloneDX v1.5 CBOM** (Cryptography Bill of Materials) for the merge event. The CBOM records every cryptographic operation performed during the scan: the ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) attestation signature, the BLAKE3 structural hashes, and the per-symbol audit entries covering `{timestamp}{file_path}{sha256_pre_cleanup}`. No token flag. No manual step. The proof is issued by the SaaS on a clean merge — a chain of custody for every line of code removed from production.

## PR Gate: Live Results

```
PRs analyzed (Godot Engine, Feb 2026) : 50
Unlinked PRs                           : 41  (82%)
Antipatterns flagged                   : 10
AI comment violations                  : 0
Highest slop score                     : 70  (PR #116833)
```

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Static reference graph + 6-stage heuristic pipeline identifies every dead symbol.
2. **Simulate** — Shadow Tree overlays links to dead files. Your test suite runs against simulated deletion.
3. **Remove** — Tests pass? Byte-precise surgical removal, bottom-to-top. Tests fail? Full rollback, zero corruption.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Detect dead code (free)
janitor scan ./src

# Find duplicate functions (free)
janitor dedup ./src

# PR enforcement gate — score a diff (free)
janitor bounce ./src --patch diff.patch

# Shadow-simulate + remove dead code (free)
janitor clean ./src --force-purge
```

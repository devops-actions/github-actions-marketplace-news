## Action Summary

The **combine-rss-feeds** GitHub Action automates the process of fetching entries from multiple RSS and Atom feeds, merging them into a single RSS 2.0 XML file, and sorting the entries by publication date (newest first). It simplifies the aggregation of content from various sources into a unified feed, with configurable options for entry limits, output file location, and custom feed metadata. This action eliminates the need for manual feed combination and ensures content is organized and up-to-date.

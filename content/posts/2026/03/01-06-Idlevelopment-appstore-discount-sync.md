## Action Summary

The "App Store IAP Pricing Updater" GitHub Action automates the synchronization of App Store in-app purchase (IAP) prices between products while maintaining a consistent, configurable discount across all countries using Apple's local price tiers. It solves the problem of inconsistent discounts caused by Apple's automatic price propagation by calculating and applying precise discounted price tiers for each country. This ensures uniform pricing relationships and predictable discounts globally, reducing the manual effort and errors associated with managing IAP pricing across multiple regions.

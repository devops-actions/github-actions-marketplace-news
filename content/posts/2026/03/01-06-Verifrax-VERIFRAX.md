## Action Summary

VERIFRAX is a GitHub Action designed to serve as a deterministic CI gate for supply chain security by evaluating software artifacts against a frozen governance policy. It automates the verification of artifacts (e.g., SBOMs, provenance, or Sigstore bundles) to produce audit-grade, offline-verifiable certificates, ensuring consistent, tamper-proof policy enforcement. This action addresses the need for reliable and transparent artifact validation in CI/CD workflows and enhances supply chain security.

## Release notes

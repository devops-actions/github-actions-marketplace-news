## Action Summary

The `readme-to-index` GitHub Action automates the conversion of a `README.md` file into a clean, minimal `index.html` static website using Pandoc and Simple.css, while leaving the original Markdown file unchanged. It simplifies the process by eliminating the need for complex setups like Jekyll or additional configuration files, making it ideal for small projects or CI pipelines. Key features include automatic title generation from the first heading, classless styling, and straightforward integration into build workflows.

## Release notes

Allow Pandoc installation when running in an environment that doesn't include `sudo`.

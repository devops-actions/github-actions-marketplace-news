## Action Summary

The **Jira Action Man** GitHub Action automates the process of extracting Jira issue keys from GitHub events, such as branch names, PR titles, commit messages, and PR bodies, and optionally posts PR descriptions as comments to the corresponding Jira tickets. It helps streamline project management by linking GitHub activity with Jira issues and supports features like configurable filters, custom regex patterns, and deduplication of comments on Jira. This action is particularly useful for teams looking to maintain traceability and synchronize work between GitHub and Jira seamlessly.

## Release notes

Jira Action Manager

Basically MVP is to just send the PR comments to the Jira ticket as a comment.

Created cause I needed a way to sync QA instructions to a ticket, including screenshots.

This should work with basic markdown.

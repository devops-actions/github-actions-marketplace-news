## Action Summary

The **hide-comment-action** GitHub Action automates the process of minimizing or hiding specific comments in a pull request, particularly those created by the `github-actions` user. It allows users to filter and hide comments based on conditions such as the author or the content of the comment (e.g., starting, ending, or containing specific text). This action helps keep pull requests organized by reducing clutter from automated comments.

## Action Summary

The "Pull Requests Labeling Action" is a GitHub Action that automatically adds a specified label to pull requests, streamlining PR triage and reducing manual workload for maintainers. It helps enforce consistent labeling practices across repositories and enables further automation, such as review routing or release management, based on the applied labels. The action validates pull request contexts, uses the GitHub REST API to add labels, and provides clear error handling for unsupported events or API failures.

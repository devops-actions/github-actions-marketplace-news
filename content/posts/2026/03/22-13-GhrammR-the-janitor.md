Version updated for **https://github.com/GhrammR/the-janitor** to version **v7.8.6**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/the-janitor-stop-the-slop) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The Janitor is a GitHub Action designed as a structural firewall that enforces code integrity by detecting AI-generated vulnerabilities, structural issues, and zombie dependencies in pull requests before they are merged. It automates the identification and categorization of risks (e.g., security antipatterns, dead code, or dependency mismanagement) while generating actionable financial and structural impact reports. With zero-copy execution, real-time dashboards, and entropy-based AI detection, it provides robust protection and analysis for maintaining software quality in AI-driven development workflows.

## Release notes

# The Janitor: Structural Firewall for AI-Generated Code
**v7.8.6 — Rust-Native. Zero-Copy. Pro-Entropic Resilience at the Gate.**

> **Sonar finds style violations.**
> **The Janitor enforces structural integrity.**

> *82% of open Godot Engine pull requests contain no issue link. 20% introduce language antipatterns. Zero comment scanners caught it. The Janitor did — across 50 live PRs, in under 90 seconds.*

## The Problem

The Veracode 2025 State of Software Security report established the baseline: AI-assisted code contains **36% more high-severity vulnerabilities** than human-written equivalents. Your linter passes Copilot output. Your SAST tool uploads it to a cloud pipeline. By the time the report arrives, the PR is merged.

The threat model has changed. Your enforcement layer has not.

## Zero-Friction GitHub Integration

![Janitor Sentinel Demo](docs/assets/sentinel_demo.webp)

*Janitor Sentinel automatically downgrades vetoes when it detects safe patterns (e.g., Dependabot).*

## The Enforcement Layer

The Janitor is not a linter. It is a **structural firewall** that runs on your hardware, on every pull request — before the merge button is available.

### Actuarial Risk Matrix

The Janitor doesn't just find vulnerabilities — it generates a financial ledger. Every intercepted threat is categorized and billed:

- **Critical Threat** (security antipattern or Swarm collision): **$150/incident** — CI pipeline poisoned, supply-chain injection vector, or coordinated Agentic Swarm clone.
- **Necrotic GC** (dead-code ghost, bot-closeable): **$20/PR** — automated garbage collection, no human triage required.
- **Total Economic Impact** = sum of all categorical billings across the audit window.

Audited **33,000 PRs across 22 enterprise repositories on an 8 GB laptop.** The ledger is machine-generated, per-PR, and appended to `.janitor/bounce_log.ndjson` atomically on every merge event.

### Integrity Dashboard (WOPR)

```
janitor dashboard <repo>
```

Visualize C/C++ compile-time blast radius and track structural Swarm clones in real-time. The WOPR (War Operations Plan Response) dashboard renders the top-10 `#include` dependency silos ranked by transitive reach — the files whose modification ripples furthest through the compile graph. Built from in-memory libgit2 tree walks; no filesystem checkout required.

### Pro-Entropic Resilience

The v7.8.6 NCD Entropy Gate compresses every patch blob via `zstd` and measures `compressed_len / raw_len`. AI-generated boilerplate is self-similar: it compresses below ratio `0.15`. Any blob crossing that threshold triggers `HighGenerativeVerbosity` (+50 points) before tree-sitter parses a single node.

Two complementary shields eliminate false positives on legitimate non-application content:

- **Null-Vector Collision Shield** — IaC bypass (`.nix`, `.lock`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.csv`) + 256-byte size guard + `DOMAIN_VENDORED` router. CVE vendor patches touching `thirdparty/` score zero by construction. No legitimate infrastructure change can produce a spurious non-zero score.
- **Net-Negative Exemption** — All score multipliers act exclusively on *newly introduced* symbols and patterns. Deletion-dominant patches — boilerplate purges, dead API removal, deprecated-code cleanup — mathematically cannot trigger any scoring signal. Score=0 is a proof, not a heuristic.

### Zero-Copy Execution

Every analysis executes via **memory-mapped file access**. Source code is never copied to heap, never serialized, never transmitted. No network call is made during the dead-symbol pipeline.

**Benchmark:** 3.5 million lines of Godot Engine — **33 seconds, 58 MB peak RAM.** On a standard CI runner. Zero panics.

### Zombie Dependency Detection

AI generators hallucinate package imports. The Janitor scans `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `spin.toml`, and `wrangler.toml` against the live symbol reference graph. A package that appears in your manifest but never appears in a reachable import path is a zombie dependency — flagged before merge.

### Cryptographic Integrity Bonds

When a pull request clears the slop gate, **Janitor Sentinel** — our GitHub App — automatically issues a **CycloneDX v1.5 CBOM** (Cryptography Bill of Materials) for the merge event. The CBOM records every cryptographic operation performed during the scan: the ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) attestation signature, the BLAKE3 structural hashes, and the per-symbol audit entries covering `{timestamp}{file_path}{sha256_pre_cleanup}`. No token flag. No manual step. The proof is issued by the SaaS on a clean merge — a chain of custody for every line of code removed from production.

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Static reference graph + 6-stage heuristic pipeline identifies every dead symbol.
2. **Simulate** — Shadow Tree overlays links to dead files. Your test suite runs against simulated deletion.
3. **Remove** — Tests pass? Byte-precise surgical removal, bottom-to-top. Tests fail? Full rollback, zero corruption.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Detect dead code (free)
janitor scan ./src

# Find duplicate functions (free)
janitor dedup ./src

# PR enforcement gate — score a diff (free)
janitor bounce ./src --patch diff.patch

# Shadow-simulate + remove dead code (free)
janitor clean ./src --force-purge
```

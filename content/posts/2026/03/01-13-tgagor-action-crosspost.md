## Action Summary

The `action-crosspost` GitHub Action automates the process of fetching URLs from a sitemap or RSS/Atom feed, filtering them based on specific criteria (e.g., age or patterns), and crossposting them to multiple social media platforms like Twitter/X, Mastodon, LinkedIn, and more. It simplifies content sharing by pre-filling messages with metadata and providing flexible controls such as dry-run mode, failure handling, and scheduling to optimize post timing. This action is ideal for streamlining social media workflows and ensuring consistent content updates across platforms.

## Action Summary

Bernstein is a deterministic orchestrator for CLI coding agents that ensures reproducible and isolated runs. It schedules tasks with plain Python, logs lineage, and provides an audit log for verification after execution. The tool helps avoid non-determinism by using hashes to detect mismatches at the exact step. Each task operates in its own Git worktree, ensuring no shared mutable state between agents.

## What's Changed

A correctness release. Three surfaces that reported success while doing
something else are fixed: a required quality gate now blocks the merge it was
already logging about, `--plan-only` no longer runs the work it was asked to
describe, and the write-ahead log recovers a torn tail onto its real
predecessor instead of forking the hash chain off genesis. Around those, the
reap path stops losing agents to worktree-layout drift, the documentation was
re-checked against the code rather than against itself, and the mypy backlog
came down by several hundred errors across a dozen packages. Upgrade in place;
read the behaviour changes first.

## Behaviour changes (read before upgrading)

- **A failed required quality gate now stops the merge (#3254).** One `or` in
  `_evaluate_approval_gate` covered two unrelated conditions: "no approval gate
  is configured" and "the required gate failed". Returning `skip_merge=False`
  is right for the first and wrong for the second, so a failed gate was
  reported, recorded as `blocked` in `quality_gates.jsonl`, and the branch
  merged about 300ms later anyway. The two conditions are now separate. This is
  a behaviour change in the direction of the documented contract: work that
  previously merged past a failing required gate no longer merges, so a project
  that had a permanently red required gate will start seeing merges refused —
  which is what the gate was for.

- **`--plan-only` no longer executes the run when the plan came from a
  positional plan file (#3255).** `plan_file` is positional, so
  `bernstein run plan.yaml --plan-only` took the plan-file dispatch, which
  called the bootstrap entry point and returned before the flag was ever
  consulted: task server, watchdog, spawner, a live agent, a worktree, a
  commit, the merge path, exit code 0. The flag is now checked ahead of the
  whole `--plan-file` / `--from-plan` dispatch, because it is a property of the
  run and not of how the plan was supplied. With a plan file present the
  preview renders the loaded plan, so its tasks appear with their roles and
  models instead of a single synthetic task built from the plan's name, and the
  rerun hint points back at the plan file rather than at `--from-plan`, which
  reads only the goal line and would re-decompose from the plan name. The saved
  plan is written as UTF-8; the render always emits status glyphs, so the
  platform default encoding raised `UnicodeEncodeError` on a cp1252 locale.

- **A stalled agent that is still writing bytes now gets reaped (#3058).** The
  escalation ladder and the Tier-1 watchdog both treat a recently-written
  runner log as proof of life, and every adapter except `claude` merges the
  child's stderr into that same file — so retry chatter, a spinner, or a
  deprecation warning refreshed the mtime and reset the ladder, with no upper
  bound. The deferral is now capped by `AGENT.liveness_suppression_cap_s`
  (900s, overridable via `tuning.agent.liveness_suppression_cap_s`). Below the
  cap a slow first turn keeps the grace it was given; past that much continuous
  heartbeat silence the mtime is read as output noise and the ladder escalates,
  so a stuck agent releases its worker slot at the escalation threshold instead
  of holding it to the wall-clock hard cap.

- **The MCP deprecated tool aliases announced in v3.11.0 for removal in this
  release are still served.** That removal did not land in this cycle. Set
  `BERNSTEIN_MCP_DEPRECATED_ALIASES=0` to drop them now and surface any caller
  still using an old name.

## Write-ahead log

Four defects in `core/persistence/wal.py`, each reproduced against unmodified
code before the fix (#3270, #3271, #3272, #3273).

- Torn-tail recovery no longer forks the chain. `_load_tail` fell back to
  `(count - 1, GENESIS_HASH)` when the trailing line failed to parse, so the
  next `append` chained its `prev_hash` off genesis rather than off its real
  predecessor and the chain forked silently at the truncation point. Recovery
  now rescans for the last entry whose stored `entry_hash` equals the SHA-256
  of its own payload and resumes both `seq` and `prev_hash` from there, so a
  partially-written line cannot become the chain anchor.
- `append` is fsync-failure-safe. It wrote and fsynced before advancing `seq`
  and `prev_hash`, so an `fsync` raising `ENOSPC` or `EIO` left the line
  durable with the counters unadvanced and the caller's retry reused the same
  sequence number. The file length is now recorded before the write and
  truncated back on any failure, then the original error is re-raised.
- Recovery reads verify before trusting. `find_orphaned_claims` and
  `get_uncommitted_entries` treated every parsed entry as authoritative. Both
  now read through `WALReader.iter_verified_entries`, which applies the same
  two checks `verify_chain` makes and drops entries failing either.
  Verification is per entry rather than a whole-file gate, because a crashed
  run's WAL legitimately ends in a torn line and gating the whole file would
  discard exactly the orphans recovery exists to reclaim.
- `close_wal` fsyncs the marker's parent directory, so the dirent cannot be
  lost in a crash and leave recovery re-scanning an already-handled WAL.

## Agent lifecycle and reaping

- The reap tick's log and `.git` liveness probe resolves the agent log in every
  worktree layout instead of one hardcoded path (#3215), and usage accounting
  and the stall-detection aggregator now do the same (#3216). Both consumers
  probed only the legacy `.sdd/worktrees/<id>/` shape, so a session under the
  current default layout produced no signal at all: token accounting silently
  under-reported, and stall profiling ran on an empty log summary rather than
  failing loudly. Both now reuse the same worktree-directory helper, and
  `check_stalled_tasks` passes the session's own reported log path, which the
  remote runtime bridge, container, and sandbox spawn paths need because no
  candidate layout would find it.
- The reap liveness probe is guarded against a session with no local PID
  (#3212).
- A heartbeat's `status` is no longer folded into its `phase` (#3202). The two
  describe different things — the heartbeat file's own lifecycle versus the
  agent's work stage — and a `phase or status` fallback meant `phase="starting"`
  arrived with no writer in the tree producing it. The monitor now reads `phase`
  alone, and the pre-spawn writer emits `phase="starting"` explicitly from a
  single shared helper. Both halves are load-bearing: an adapter with
  `consumes_heartbeat_dir=False` never overwrites the spawn-time file, so that
  writer is the only source of the starting phase for that whole population,
  and dropping the fallback without it would have flagged a slow first turn
  against the general threshold instead of the starting window.

## Verifiability

- Trajectory receipt verification checks the stored bytes rather than a decoded
  projection of them (#3211). Verification decoded the file into dataclasses
  and rehashed the object, and the decode is lossy twice over: unrecognised
  keys are dropped, and `journal_entry_hash` fell back to a `.get` default.
  Anything outside the schema never reached the hash, so an edited receipt
  could verify clean. Three claims the module made that its code did not
  implement were corrected at the same time.

## Test selection and CI

- Diff-scoped test selection picks workflow guards by what they read rather
  than by their file name (#3214). The old rule matched the substring
  `workflow` in the test filename, so a guard named after the workflow it pins
  — reading the same YAML, breaking on the same edit — was dropped from the
  slice. Workflow-only pull requests merged green and the breakage surfaced on
  `main` when the full suite ran.
- The stock-server sweep drives the documented SSE operations as streams
  (#3274), so an endpoint documented as streaming is now exercised as one.

## Terminal UI

Four defects reported from a single session against the TUI, each fixed with
the test that reproduces it: the debounce timer handles are annotated as
`Timer` rather than `object`, which was hiding a missing `stop()` (#3247);
`TaskSearchInput.__init__` no longer raises `TypeError` when a caller passes
`placeholder` explicitly (#3248); the approval panel reads the selected row
from `row_key` instead of `cursor_row`, which is an `int` and was never the
attribute wanted (#3249); and `ApprovalAction` is a real `Message` subclass, so
`post_message()` type-checks against what it actually receives (#3251).

## Cost and provider data

- The MiniMax price table is refreshed and carries cache tiers (#3261); the
  shipped table had drifted from the published rates.
- `provider_latency` skips malformed JSONL records instead of raising on the
  first bad numeric field (#3288), so one corrupt line no longer takes down the
  whole reading.

## Typing

The mypy backlog came down across twelve packages this cycle: `core/protocols`
(93 to 41), `cli/commands` (73 to 3), `core/routing` (52 to 0),
`core/observability` (50 to 3), `core/quality` (47 to 15), `tui` (41 to 15),
`core/communication` (35 to 0), `core/tasks` (23 to 3), plus `core/routes`,
`core/config`, and `adapters`. The pattern that recurs is string constants fed
into `cast()` — mypy cannot use a string as a type — converted to real PEP 695
`type` aliases; after that, explicit declarations where a first-branch
assignment fixed a variable's type too early, and casts into the nested shape a
`dict[str, object]` read actually has. No `# type: ignore` was added to buy any
of it, and the three errors left in `cli/commands` are real defects an
annotation cannot honestly paper over, filed separately rather than silenced.

## Documentation

- Capability claims were verified against the code, with stale counts and
  examples corrected (#3275).
- The adapter last-green table is regenerated from canary receipts rather than
  maintained by hand (#3218, #3280).

## Contributors

This release carries work from:

- **casbrbr-beep** — found and reported the quality-gate polarity defect
  (#3254, P0) and contributed the fix (#3266); diagnosed `--plan-only` (#3255)
  down to the exact dispatch branch after a first static read had cleared it,
  and specified the design this release implements.
- **bymyforge** — annotated the `tui` package (#3236), typed the debounce timer
  handles (#3252), fixed the approval-panel row-selection crash (#3253), and
  filed four TUI defects (#3247, #3248, #3249, #3251) with reproductions.
- **qwenbona** — separated heartbeat status from phase, both halves (#3223).
- **seescer** — annotated the `core/observability` package (#3265).
- **PyaaZz** — annotated the `core/routes` package (#3267).
- **MochiGem** — converted the `core/config` string constant type aliases to
  `type` statements (#3287).
- **Iqbalez** — hardened the provider-latency reader against malformed records
  (#3294).
- **w3lld1** — defined the adapter cast aliases as types (#3246).
- **mmaxjr** — made `bernstein doctor` report a missing `uv` as a failed check
  instead of crashing with a raw traceback (#3258).
- **octo-patch** — corrected the MiniMax price table and added its cache tiers
  (#3261).

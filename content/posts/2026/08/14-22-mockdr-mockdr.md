## Action Summary

The mockdr action is a self-contained multi-EDR mock server that provides realistic data and response formats for eight security platforms, including SentinelOne, CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Elastic Security, Cortex XDR, Splunk SIEM, and Microsoft Sentinel. It supports various authentication methods and response formats to simulate real API interactions without the need for live environments or lab licenses. The action is designed to facilitate testing and development of EDR integration tools and automation scripts across multiple platforms.

## What's Changed


First tagged release since the project was opened up; `v1.0.4` pointed at the
initial commit. The major bump reflects two behaviour changes rather than a
rewrite: an unparseable OData `$filter` is now refused instead of quietly
returning the wrong rows, and the UI moved to Tailwind CSS v4.

### Security

- Dependency advisories published since the last refresh are cleared:
  `python-multipart` 0.0.22 → 0.0.32 (PYSEC-2026-3036/3037/3038/3039/3040) and
  `pytest` 9.0.2 → 9.0.3 (PYSEC-2026-1845), plus transitive frontend bumps of
  `form-data`, `nanoid`, `picomatch`, `postcss` and `yaml`. `pip-audit` and
  `npm audit` both report zero vulnerabilities.
- Splunk index creation, HEC token management and KV Store collection
  management now require an administrator role. `require_splunk_admin` existed
  but was never applied, so the seeded `viewer` could create indexes and mint
  HEC tokens. `sc_admin` counts as an administrator, as it does in Splunk Cloud.

### Added

- OData `$filter` supports `endswith(field,'value')`, which real Graph serves
  and mockdr previously rejected.
- Unquoted `true`, `false`, `null`, `Edm.Guid` and ISO-8601 date/time literals
  are recognised in `$filter`, as OData v4 writes them.
- EDR→SIEM bridging is live (ADR-009): the Splunk and Sentinel bridges are
  registered at startup and EDR mutations publish to the event bus, so a
  Defender alert or a triggered scenario now appears in the SIEMs. Both bridges
  and the bus were previously unreachable code.
- MDE list endpoints support `$count=true`, returning `@odata.count`.

### Changed

- **An unparseable or unsupported OData `$filter` returns `400` instead of
  being partly ignored.** Input the parser could not read used to be skipped,
  which *widened* the filter — `$filter=@@@` returned every record with a
  `200`, and a stray paren silently dropped the rest of the expression.
  Unsupported-but-valid syntax (`not`, `in`, nested functions) previously
  raised and surfaced as `500`. Both now answer `400` in the vendor's error
  envelope, matching Defender and Graph. No filter that worked before stops
  working.
- **The UI is built with Tailwind CSS v4.** Tailwind's default palette moved to
  OKLCH, so built-in colours (`text-green-400` and friends) render slightly
  more vivid; a 13-page screenshot comparison found 12 pages byte-identical and
  the custom `s1-*` palette unchanged.
- The version is defined once per workspace — `config.APP_VERSION`,
  `pyproject.toml` and `package.json` — and the sidebar footer reads it at
  build time instead of hardcoding a string. The five sources previously
  disagreed. A unit test now fails if they drift apart.
- Dependencies refreshed: FastAPI 0.141.1, faker 40.36.0, ruff 0.16.2,
  pytest-cov 7.1.0, pre-commit 4.6.2, vue-router 5.2.0, lucide-vue-next 1.0.0,
  jsdom 30.0.1 and `@types/node` 26.2.0.
- The Graph, MDE and Sentinel token endpoints return OAuth 2.0 errors —
  `{"error": "...", "error_description": "AADSTS...", "error_codes": [...]}` —
  instead of the OData envelope of the API they sit in front of. MSAL and other
  OAuth clients read those keys.
- `GET /graph/v1.0/me` returns `400 Request_BadRequest` under app-only
  authentication, as real Graph does, instead of returning the first seeded user.
- Splunk endpoints now answer in Atom XML unless `output_mode=json` is
  requested, as splunkd does. HEC still always answers JSON.
- Sentinel management-plane requests now require `?api-version=`, as Azure
  Resource Manager does. The Log Analytics query endpoint is unaffected.
- Graph `$count=true` now requires `ConsistencyLevel: eventual` instead of being
  answered regardless.

### Fixed

- `contains()` and `startswith()` in an OData `$filter` returned `500` on every
  call, on both MDE and Graph — the tokeniser consumed the opening paren as
  part of the function token and the parser then demanded it again. These are
  the forms the XSOAR MDE integration and Microsoft's Graph documentation lead
  with. Graph imports the parser from MDE, so one defect reached both.
- `and` bound *looser* than `or` in an OData `$filter`, inverting the
  precedence OData specifies: `a and b or c` evaluated as `a and (b or c)`, so
  records matching only the `or` arm were dropped. The parser builds a tree
  rather than a flat clause list, and parentheses nest correctly.
- `accountEnabled eq true` matched nothing and `ne true` matched everything —
  unquoted keywords were compared as strings against `str(True)`, i.e. `"True"`.
- Unquoted timestamps were truncated to their year, so `createdDateTime ge
  2026-08-08T00:00:00Z` compared against `2026` and answered far more coarsely
  than asked. Unquoted GUIDs were shredded the same way.
- A doubled quote — OData's escape for a literal one — ended the string, so
  `startswith(displayName,'O''Brien')` matched every name starting with `O`.
- Deeply nested parentheses raised `RecursionError` and surfaced as `500`,
  reachable from a short query string. Nesting is capped.
- Every in-repo caller of the Sentinel operations endpoint omitted the
  `api-version` parameter that ARM enforcement had just made mandatory,
  including the UI's health check, which returned `400` at runtime. The test
  fixture supplied the parameter automatically, hiding it from the suite.
- `apply_graph_filter` leaked its synthetic `_lambda_*` keys into the caller's
  records when a filter failed to parse; cleanup now runs unconditionally.
- Cortex XDR advanced authentication now uses the documented scheme —
  `SHA256(key + nonce + timestamp)` over the plain concatenation — instead of an
  HMAC over `nonce:timestamp`, which rejected every client built to Palo Alto's
  specification. Standard authentication (the API key in `Authorization`) is
  supported as well.
- Request-validation failures are returned in the mocked vendor's error envelope
  with the status that vendor uses, instead of FastAPI's `422 {"detail": [...]}`,
  which no mocked API emits.
- `POST /mde/api/indicators` now rejects a body missing `indicatorValue`,
  `indicatorType`, `action` or `title` with `400 BadRequest` instead of creating
  an indicator with empty fields.
- Authorization scheme names are matched case-insensitively for Sentinel and
  Splunk, per RFC 7235.
- Splunk accepts a session key in its own `Authorization: Splunk <key>` scheme,
  not only as `Bearer`.
- Graph reports a missing resource with the code its sub-API uses:
  `Request_ResourceNotFound` for directory objects, `ErrorItemNotFound` for
  Outlook mail, `itemNotFound` for drive items and `notFound` for the security
  API.
- A state snapshot now covers every seeded collection. Graph, Sentinel, Splunk
  and hash exceptions were absent from the registry, and because loading a
  snapshot skips seeding, restarting with `MOCKDR_PERSIST` left those vendors
  permanently empty. A coverage test now fails if a new collection is missed.
- Sentinel rejects a `$skipToken` it did not issue with `400 InvalidSkipToken`
  instead of raising `ValueError` and returning a 500, and `nextLink` is now the
  absolute, followable URL ARM returns rather than a bare `?$skipToken=`.
- `POST /iocs/bulk` accepts a single indicator sent as an object instead of
  silently discarding it and reporting success.
- Activity records evicted from the bounded order deque are deleted with it, so
  `count()` and `list_activities()` no longer diverge past 10,000 activities.
- The Webhooks UI reads `eventTypes` and `createdAt`, the field names the API
  actually returns; it previously read snake_case and threw while rendering.
- `frontend/.env` is created from `.env.example` by `start.sh` and the Docker
  build. Vite inlines `VITE_*` at build time, so without it every vendor client
  in the UI authenticated as `undefined`.
- `xdr_api_key_repo.get_by_key_id` is a single dict lookup instead of rebuilding
  an index on every call, matching what its docstring already claimed.

- Graph, MDE and Sentinel token endpoints now accept the tenant-scoped URL real
  Entra ID uses (`/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`) in addition to the bare path, so
  clients that mirror the Microsoft authority shape no longer fall through to
  the SPA catch-all and get a misleading `405 Method Not Allowed` ([#22]).
  Like Entra, the segment accepts the tenant GUID or a verified domain name; a
  tenant that matches neither is rejected with `400 invalid_request`
  (AADSTS90002). Set `MOCKDR_STRICT_TENANT=false` to accept any tenant.

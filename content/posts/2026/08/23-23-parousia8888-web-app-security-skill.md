## What's Changed

# v0.5.4 release evidence

Status: published. The signed tag, GitHub Release, npm package with provenance, verified installer
trust entry and signed `v1` promotion are publicly verifiable.

## Outcome

Scope, audit, harden, and retest web projects with AI coding agents and reproducible evidence.

v0.5.4 expands the bounded automatic first pass. Five built-in rules cover exact Git tracking of
sensitive `.env` names, JavaScript session-secret/cookie settings and Python session-cookie/CSRF
settings. Eight project-owned Opengrep rules add same-file request-to-SQL, outbound-URL, file-path
and redirect flows across JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. `--profile deep` selects the built-in
detector plus the four existing external adapters without downloading them.

The release retains the corrected evidence claim: the self-authored planted suite is named
rule-contract conformance and reports literal positive/negative/state contract results. A separate
historical real-world regression corpus executes four minimized correctness failures and one
review-visible expected benign DOM-sink match against product code.

The main-branch try-now command follows npm latest. Reusable CI, signed release verification and the
trusted installer remain pinned to an immutable version or source commit.

## Evidence sets

- [`v0.5.4 rule-contract conformance`](../conformance/v0.5.4-rule-contract-conformance.md): 25
  built-in risk and 2 evidence-integrity planted positive/negative/state contracts.
- [`v0.5.4 historical real-world regressions`](../regressions/v0.5.4-real-world-regressions.md):
  report-summary rendering, pnpm workspace lock inheritance, nested-template coverage,
  path-equivalent retest handling and numeric SVG DOM-sink review.
- [`Known limitations`](../../KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md): parser, evidence-state, incremental-audit and
  claim boundaries.

Neither evidence set is a representative production-vulnerability benchmark. Stable detector reach
is 25 built-in risk rules, 2 evidence-integrity rules and 16 opt-in external-adapter rules: 43 total.
Opengrep matches remain same-file `suspected` leads. A missing deep-profile prerequisite is explicit
`unknown` evidence and exit 3, never a clean result.

## Published verification

The local release gates include:

```bash
npm run conformance:rules
npm run regressions:real-world
npm run check
/usr/local/bin/python3 /Users/kenn/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py .
```

The release procedure additionally verifies the signed tag after it exists:

```bash
git -c gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile=.github/release-signers verify-tag v0.5.4
```

Artifact identity, signatures and provenance establish origin and byte identity. They do not prove
that every detector conclusion is correct or that a scanned project is secure.

## What's Changed

# v0.4.0 release evidence

Scope, audit, harden, and retest web projects with AI coding agents and reproducible evidence.

Web App Security Skill v0.4.0 is the evidence-integrity and useful-detection release. It keeps the
agent-guided hardening methodology while making narrow automated results harder to overstate.

## Release identity

- Version/tag: `v0.4.0`
- Source identity: the commit peeled from the SSH-signed annotated tag; the exact 40-character SHA
  is also recorded in `web-app-security-skill-0.4.0.release.json` and the provenance attestation.
- Runtime matrix: Node.js 22 and 24 on Ubuntu and macOS; Bash 3.2 remains covered on macOS.
- External adapters: Gitleaks `8.30.1` and OSV-Scanner `2.5.0`, installed and pinned by the caller.

The Markdown file is part of the source commit it describes, so it does not embed a fabricated
self-referential commit SHA. Verify the exact published identity with the signed tag and manifest.

## Evidence model and migration

Report v2 binds findings to subject, scope, rule revision, adapter and ruleset identity. Per-rule
coverage records discovered, eligible, scanned, excluded, skipped, truncated and failed work. A
missing or incomplete check is explicit `unknown`/unavailable evidence and cannot establish `fixed`.

Historical v1 reports remain readable but are never silently comparable. `migrate-report` records
their original SHA-256 and explicit user binding as non-comparable lineage; a new persisted v2 audit
is required before a later retest can prove a fix. Moved or cloned projects require explicit
`rebind` acknowledgement rather than path or repository-name inference. See
[`docs/report-v2-migration.md`](../report-v2-migration.md).

## Detection and reporting changes

- Built-in source checks remain deliberately narrow: lockfile absence, environment-named files,
  public Node inspector bindings and common production source-map settings.
- Gitleaks checks committed history and the working tree. OSV-Scanner checks supported recorded
  lockfiles and may query the public OSV advisory service. Neither adapter is downloaded by the
  product and project dependencies are not executed.
- Every external scanner match is `suspected`. Gitleaks does not prove credential validity or
  exposure; OSV does not prove reachability, deployed version or exploitability.
- Reports separate `security_exposure`, `supply_chain`, `search_discoverability`, `reliability` and
  `evidence_integrity`. A HIGH discoverability result is not a HIGH security vulnerability.
- JSON, Markdown, HTML, SARIF and JUnit are committed as one private atomic evidence bundle after
  sanitization and validation. Existing output is not overwritten.
- The composite Action keeps v0.3 crawl behavior and adds source mode. External findings require an
  acknowledged alert-owner policy before they can affect the configured gate.

## Five-project evidence

The dated `2026-08-14` corpus ran the complete v2 source path at immutable commits without probing a
hosted project or executing project dependencies.

| Project | Confirmed | Suspected | Boundary |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Linkwarden | 0 | 270 | OSV advisory rows are mutable suspected leads |
| Healthchecks | 0 | 98 | Gitleaks documentation/test matches suspected; OSV not applicable |
| Open WebUI | 0 | 144 | Source-map and OSV leads suspected; public `.map` delivery unknown |
| Uptime Kuma | 4 | 93 | Four low-severity missing-lockfile facts in independent `extra/` tools; external leads suspected |
| Mealie | 0 | 30 | Gitleaks test-material matches suspected |

These records demonstrate applicability, state discipline and false-positive closure. They are not
labelled benchmark data and do not support a precision/recall score. OSV counts can change as its
public advisory database changes. Reproduction commands and unreached surfaces are in
[`docs/case-studies/journeys/`](../case-studies/journeys/README.md).

## Regressions fixed

- Cross-project, tampered, forged, v1 or incomplete baselines cannot manufacture a fixed result.
- Deep, large, unreadable, malformed and truncated source candidates remain visible in coverage.
- Crawler-range, sitemap and AWS permission failures become unknown evidence, never a clean result.
- Cross-domain severity is no longer combined into one security headline.
- Evidence writes are private, atomic, non-overwriting and rolled back after handled failures.
- External-tool missing/version/timeout/error/malformed paths fail closed; upstream OSV severity
  cannot inflate local severity.
- Duplicate Gitleaks rows are deduplicated while distinct fingerprints remain distinct; finding IDs
  survive sanitizer patterns that resemble numeric account identifiers.

The complete bug-to-test map is [`docs/regression-inventory.md`](../regression-inventory.md).

## Release verification

The release workflow runs the full gate, builds every artifact twice and compares bytes, verifies
archive paths, manifest, SHA-256 list and SPDX 2.3 SBOM, then exercises an isolated v0.3.0-to-v0.4.0
upgrade plus clean install/version/start/upgrade/uninstall behavior. GitHub provenance is requested
only after those checks pass. A separate consumer repository verifies both backward-compatible crawl
mode and built-in source mode against the exact candidate/release commit.

Verify the published tag after release:

```bash
git -c gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile=.github/release-signers verify-tag v0.4.0
```

Verify downloaded assets with `SHA256SUMS`, then compare the manifest source commit with
`git rev-parse 'v0.4.0^{}'` and verify GitHub provenance. The post-publication verifier now trusts
the immutable v0.4.0 asset digests, and the documented bootstrap pins and verifies that verifier
before installation.

## Unsupported and unknown

- This is not a general SAST/DAST scanner, authenticated pentest or automatic patching system.
- BOLA/IDOR, business logic, LLM/OAuth, database isolation and most framework-specific sinks remain
  agent-guided and require project context.
- No authenticated third-party deployment, production cloud account or upstream live system was
  actively tested for this release.
- Native Windows, PowerShell and WSL2 are unsupported because no maintained verification environment
  exists. Node 20 and earlier are not supported release targets.
- Release signatures, checksums and attestations establish artifact identity and build origin; they
  do not prove every security conclusion is correct or that an installed project is secure.

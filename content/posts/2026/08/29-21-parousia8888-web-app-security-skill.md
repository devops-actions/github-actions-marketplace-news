## What's Changed

# v0.8.0 release evidence

Status: complete. Immutable release, npm package, verified installer and signed `v1` are published.
The immutable and moving-alias consumers passed, and the byte-matched durable live-verification
record is available as both a workflow artifact and GitHub Release asset.

Scope, audit, harden, and retest web projects with AI coding agents and reproducible evidence.

## Outcome

v0.8.0 deepens the existing JavaScript/TypeScript route review without adding a framework, ORM,
general SAST or automatic-repair claim.

- Route-security v3 follows exact route, query, direct JSON-body and Server Action object selectors
  through at most four exact project-local call edges.
- Object, principal and tenant facts remain separate. Supported Prisma/Drizzle operations record
  visible query predicates, supported post-load comparisons, absent supported constraints or
  incomplete evidence as different outcomes.
- Express, NestJS, Next.js App Router and Next.js Server Actions share one bounded project graph,
  while framework inventory and access-path coverage remain independent.
- Compatible v3 baselines can expose lost authorization evidence or incomplete current paths.
  Route-security v1/v2 baselines are `not_comparable / route_schema_changed` under v3.
- Each rendered review lead includes the professional term, plain-language meaning, conditional
  consequence, evidence limit, review proposal, change risk and owner/non-owner/normal-flow checks.

`completed` means the bounded static model reached a supported operation. It does not prove runtime
reachability, correct authorization, control-flow dominance, exploitability or absence of an
unsupported path. Clerk, Better Auth and Supabase remain experimental; Supabase always requires
deployed RLS-policy evidence.

## Fixed-commit effectiveness evidence

The denominator was frozen before implementation at 14 eligible paths across four exact public
commits, with a target of 10 and a six-path grounded floor. It was not reduced after misses.

- 13 of 14 frozen paths completed: Drizzle 6/6 and Prisma 7/8.
- The sole miss, Formbricks `ACTION getMembershipRole`, remains partial with
  `argument_mapping_ambiguous` and `call_target_unresolved`.
- The review contains 63 distinct completed operation chains and 50 additional completed review
  paths outside the frozen score; additional paths were not added to the denominator.
- Four completed paths retain supporting limitations. Completion does not erase them.
- Same-machine median runtime ratios were 1.10x to 1.41x against the v0.7.3 baseline, below the 2x
  stop threshold for all four fixed targets.

The [review](../reviews/v0.8.0-access-control-review.md),
[provenance record](../reviews/v0.8.0-access-control-review-provenance.md) and
[minimized regression](../regressions/v0.8.0-access-control-real-world-regression.md) bind these
facts. This author-selected fixed corpus is bounded effectiveness evidence, not production
precision/recall, framework-wide coverage or a vulnerability benchmark.

## Candidate verification

The local P13 gate completed with the failure history retained rather than rewritten. The single
`npm run check` invocation stopped first on a stale curated v2 fixture; its explicit continuation
then found one duplicate-ID renderer fixture and the v0.7.3-bound active journey catalog. The
schemas and duplicate-ID validator were not relaxed. After the focused corrections, non-overlapping
runner records cover all 82 intended test files: 81 passed, zero failed, one opt-in real-adapter file
skipped and zero not run. Prerequisite surfaces record three passed and one explicit skip. The shell
smoke suite and every remaining lint/contract command passed; no second monolithic check was run.

Final local artifacts:

- npm dry-run package: v0.8.0, 215 files, 645,212 packed bytes, SHA-1
  `1b45330758998f04eeacf71166ab20310fd1c1e7`;
- SPDX 2.3 SBOM: two packages, SHA-256
  `e3a0cd020e846d6f8af3751a9ff31bf108b4e1813c958b7cc337d2a6846e295f`;
- parser bundle: SHA-256 `f8d700c78a6d0a50513a672b419074a87597093733d2d69ecee92675d8139698`;
- active five-project v0.8.0 catalog: exact tool source `80d21afbbca2075a66e761b085e7bd4752fdac7f`,
  all five fixed checkouts clean, two complete and three explicitly incomplete audit exits;
- secret scan: two intentional planted test-fixture files, zero production credential values after
  redacted manual classification;
- Skill validation, package isolation, document/product/release/distribution contracts and
  `git diff --check`: passed.

Hosted candidate verification passed before immutable publication on the final release source:

- source commit: `119cbcc7f8d327482df8abfa50a4af0b69fcceee`;
- [CI run 33263683220](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/actions/runs/33263683220):
  `success` on macOS/Ubuntu with Node 22/24, including pinned real-adapter fixtures on Ubuntu Node 22;
- [CodeQL run 33263683203](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/actions/runs/33263683203):
  `success` on the same commit;
- `main` was observed at that commit, but the branch-protection API reports that `main` is not
  protected. The hosted checks passed; their enforcement by branch protection is not claimed.

## Immutable publication evidence

```bash
git -c gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile=.github/release-signers verify-tag v0.8.0
```

The SSH-signed annotated tag object is
`e826ede4b3ee1eab9237b5ea49ba8e340da26bd5` and peels to release source
`119cbcc7f8d327482df8abfa50a4af0b69fcceee`. Repository-local SSH verification passes, and GitHub
reports `verified: true` with reason `valid` for that exact tag object.

[Release workflow 33263798089](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/actions/runs/33263798089)
completed successfully and published four immutable assets:

- `SHA256SUMS`: SHA-256
  `e606db959a83171a6d19a76ff29979e9c5155594fa993be376fb36a10c75899e`;
- release manifest: SHA-256
  `3bee5679b353c3071eac1452cf52b2439979b30ded03686afbb734eec63b846a`;
- SPDX 2.3 SBOM: SHA-256
  `cce92a9bfdd96617c59d0c49c2f59f0ce07e9ea2b529de2f0dad16f57296a137`;
- source archive: SHA-256
  `d6136bdc82975274cc0059ad0bf36e602b447dbfb9cbcca8a7a058b60bb8d888`.

The downloaded asset set passed checksum, manifest, archive lifecycle and GitHub attestation
verification. The manifest and tag identify the same release source. The archive contains 547
entries and its SBOM declares SPDX 2.3 with two packages.

[npm trusted-publishing run 33263916671](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/actions/runs/33263916671)
published `web-app-security-skill@0.8.0` from the same source. npm records shasum
`1b45330758998f04eeacf71166ab20310fd1c1e7`, integrity
`sha512-zbnRkSZ4bdMgRtXprWSp8uvgMswAGjdZstXbcObLJlOIvjnpbmmSHQzdzWPTTlID3giNFfsDH8hchnomYQfUNQ==`
and SLSA provenance for that workflow/source. All 215 npm package files match the signed release
source archive byte-for-byte. A fresh-cache exact-version consumer returned
`Web App Security Skill 0.8.0`.

Verifier commit `f55c80e7c5014ff6d39d61ca8cbb4fec2ec1fbac` records the public v0.8.0 asset
digests and has SHA-256 `0e3e27ae7f00314668337b9d0a2d8a350ac01b908ab65aa0b2856c614278d5a7`.
Bootstrap commit `12cb085d7f3a21c2b6ffb6cb2758ee4247e2af9f` fixes that verifier identity and has
SHA-256 `137b5d8fdf6f616be3aa2631e0134b354fd9142ce19419bad6c37e5b0409480f`.
Focused trust-chain tests pass locally. Public raw bootstrap retrieval, an isolated clean install
and the immutable full-SHA Action consumer have now passed. The public bootstrap matched SHA-256
`137b5d8fdf6f616be3aa2631e0134b354fd9142ce19419bad6c37e5b0409480f` before execution. It installed
all three supported targets under an isolated HOME with `--attestation required`; GitHub CLI
attestation verified successfully, and no existing user installation was touched.

[Immutable consumer run 33264836987](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/actions/runs/33264836987)
completed successfully against the full release source SHA. The owned Express/Prisma fixture
produced route-security v3 with completed bounded-path coverage and an observed owner constraint,
without converting the review evidence into a confirmed-vulnerability claim. The moving-`v1`
consumer and live-verification jobs were intentionally skipped until P16.

## Final promotion and live verification

Signed annotated `v1` was moved with an exact guarded lease from tag object
`7bd05668153d21c1ac55ac35e8707703e2a6eb0f` to
`3e44c123d45f5fc06fa437fe1fbd58a71c5aaaa8`. It peels to immutable release source
`119cbcc7f8d327482df8abfa50a4af0b69fcceee`. Repository-local signer-policy verification passes,
and GitHub reports `verified: true` with reason `valid` for the new tag object.

[Final public verification run 33265256940](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/actions/runs/33265256940)
completed successfully on coordination commit `43dbc9bdbe31e994560212d56131f60f956805b7`. It verified:

- the immutable full-SHA Express/Prisma route-security v3 consumer;
- the signed `v1` passive crawl consumer and its authorization-refusal behavior;
- GitHub Release checksums, manifest, signed tag and build provenance;
- npm package bytes and provenance;
- an isolated all-target installer run with GitHub attestation required;
- the published moving-alias state.

The workflow produced
[`web-app-security-skill-0.8.0.live-verification.json`](https://github.com/parousia8888/web-app-security-skill/releases/download/v0.8.0/web-app-security-skill-0.8.0.live-verification.json)
as both a 90-day workflow artifact and durable Release asset. The two downloaded records matched
byte-for-byte with SHA-256
`5ff2d022a192ae2d95a805e26464d8e392d3e68d0c91f43fe4ea72887525bead`; the record reports
`live_verified` and all eight public gates as `verified`.

The expected authorization-refusal probe is visible in the workflow UI as an exit-2 annotation.
The step used `continue-on-error`, the following assertion required that failure, and the consumer
job concluded successfully. It is negative-test evidence, not an unhandled workflow failure.

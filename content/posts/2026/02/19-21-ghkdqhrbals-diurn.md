It solves the problem of manually fetching and processing GA4 data by providing an automated and structured approach to access metrics like active users, page views, and total users for specific timeframes. Key capabilities include integration with Jekyll sites, dynamic display through a JavaScript widget, and customization for hosting or styling the generated data.

## Action Summary

Agent-bom is an AI supply chain security scanner designed to identify vulnerabilities (CVEs) in packages and images while assessing configuration security risks, such as credential exposure, tool access, and privilege escalation. It automates blast radius mapping to trace vulnerabilities from packages to compromised AI agents, exposed credentials, and accessible tools, providing detailed insights into the potential business impact. Key capabilities include AI agent discovery, credential exposure analysis, malicious package detection, and compliance with frameworks like OWASP, MITRE ATLAS, and NIST AI RMF.

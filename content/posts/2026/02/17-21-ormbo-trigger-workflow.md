## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, `trigger-workflow`, automates the process of triggering a workflow in the same or a different repository while addressing limitations of GitHub's native `workflow_dispatch` API. It allows users to track and wait for the completion of the triggered workflow, providing real-time status updates and ensuring dependencies are met, which is particularly useful for continuous delivery pipelines. Key features include injecting a unique correlation ID, smart polling to identify and monitor workflow runs, and reporting final statuses back to the initiating workflow.

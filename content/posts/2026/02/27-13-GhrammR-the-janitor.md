Version updated for **https://github.com/GhrammR/the-janitor** to version **v6.8.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Docker** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/the-janitor-stop-the-slop) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The Janitor is a GitHub Action that automates the detection and cleanup of unused or "dead" code at the symbol level (functions, classes, files) for Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C++ codebases. It identifies technical debt using static analysis, simulates the impact of code removal with a "Shadow Tree" to ensure safety, and performs precise deletions if tests pass, helping teams streamline codebases and maintain code health. The action also provides a verifiable Code Health Badge and supports duplicate code detection, aiding in reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

## Release notes

# The Janitor: Automated Dead Symbol Detection & Code Cleanup
**Current Version:** v6.8.0

**Stop paying for code you don't use.**

The Janitor creates a Shadow Tree to verify deletion safety, then surgically removes dead code at the symbol level — functions, classes, and entire orphan files — across Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C++ codebases.

Don't guess your technical debt. The Janitor generates a verifiable **Code Health Badge** so your team can surgically monitor the decay of the monolith before it impacts production.

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Static reference graph + 6-stage heuristic pipeline identifies every dead symbol.
2. **Simulate** — Shadow Tree overlays links to the dead files. Your test suite runs against the simulated deletion.
3. **Remove** — Tests pass? Dead code is removed bottom-to-top (byte-precise, UTF-8 hardened). Tests fail? Full rollback, zero corruption.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Free: detect dead code
janitor scan ./src

# Free: find duplicate functions (structural clone detection)
janitor dedup ./src

# Free: simulate + remove (no token required)
janitor clean ./src --force-purge
```

## Language Support

| Language | Dead Functions | Dead Classes | Dead Files | Duplicate Logic |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Python   | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | ✓               |
| Rust     | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | —               |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | ✓ | ✓       | ✓          | —               |
| C++      | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | —               |

## False-Positive Protection

17-variant protection system. Heuristics cover:

- FastAPI route decorators, dependency injection, lifespan teardown
- Pydantic validators, forward references, alias generators
- SQLAlchemy metaprogramming, hybrid properties, polymorphic mappers
- pytest fixtures, conftest.py, test fingerprinting
- Qt auto-connection slots, ORM lifecycle methods
- Plugin directories (Scrapy, Celery, Django management commands)
- Grep shield: Aho-Corasick scan of all non-Python files

## Runtime Architecture

The Janitor is a deterministic static-analysis engine with no AI inference at runtime.

| Subsystem | Technology | Property |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **AST Engine** | Tree-sitter (9 grammars) | O(n) CST construction; byte-range precision per token |
| **Reference Graph** | Petgraph directed digraph | Topological dead-symbol filter; in-degree = 0 → candidate |
| **Pattern Matching** | Aho-Corasick (single automaton per pattern group) | O(n+m) multi-pattern scan; zero allocation in hot path |
| **Registry Persistence** | rkyv zero-copy serialization + memmap2 | mmap-direct deserialization; no heap allocation for reads |
| **Structural Hashing** | BLAKE3 (alpha-normalized AST over function body) | Logic-clone detection across identifier rename boundaries |
| **Fuzzy Dedup** | AstSimHasher (SimHash over CST token features) | Sub-millisecond pairwise comparison; classified as `Refactor`, `Zombie`, or `NewCode` |
| **PR Quality Gate** | MinHash LSH (64 hashes, 8-band index) | Lock-free ArcSwap index; sub-linear collision detection |
| **Deletion Engine** | Bottom-to-top byte-range splice | UTF-8 char-boundary hardened; zero re-parse overhead |
| **Simulation Layer** | Symlink overlay (Shadow Tree) | Zero additional disk usage; test suite runs against simulated state |
| **Audit Attestation** | Ed25519 remote signing | Binary carries only `VERIFYING_KEY_BYTES`; no private key material embedded |

## Action Summary

The **action-crosspost** GitHub Action automates the process of crossposting content to multiple social media platforms directly from a GitHub workflow. It fetches URLs from a sitemap or RSS/Atom feed, filters them based on criteria like age or URL patterns, and posts the content to networks such as Twitter, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. This action simplifies content distribution, saves time, and includes options for message customization, error handling, and dry-run previews for safe testing.

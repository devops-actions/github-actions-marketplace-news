## Action Summary

BreakPoint AI is a tool designed to evaluate and prevent issues in AI model outputs before deployment, ensuring cost efficiency, format integrity, and security compliance (e.g., detecting Personally Identifiable Information). It automates comparisons between baseline and candidate outputs, providing deterministic evaluations with clear statuses (`ALLOW`, `WARN`, or `BLOCK`) and actionable feedback. This helps streamline pre-release validation, reduce risks in production, and integrate seamlessly into CI workflows.

## Action Summary

LazyPR is an AI-powered GitHub Action designed to automate the generation of detailed, context-aware pull request summaries, risk assessments, and change logs by analyzing code diffs rather than relying solely on commit messages. It solves the problem of insufficient or unclear pull request documentation by detecting mismatched commit descriptions, assessing the impact of changes, and labeling PRs by risk level. Key capabilities include ghost commit detection, risk scoring, and support for multiple AI providers.

## Action Summary

Pipelock is an open-source agent firewall designed to monitor and secure AI agents by intercepting and scanning HTTP requests for sensitive data leaks, unauthorized domains, and integrity violations. It automates the protection of API keys and other critical information without requiring code changes, acting as a forward proxy that integrates seamlessly with popular AI frameworks like OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Code, and LangGraph. Its capabilities include data loss prevention (DLP), domain blocklisting, and runtime integrity monitoring, providing robust security for AI-driven workflows.

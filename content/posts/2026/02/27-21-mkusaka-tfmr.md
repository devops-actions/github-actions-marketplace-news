## Action Summary

The `tfmr` GitHub Action is a CLI tool designed to analyze Terraform modules and their dependencies by identifying and listing relevant `.tf` and `.tf.json` files. It automates tasks such as detecting changes in module files, filtering outputs based on file changes, and checking whether a module is affected by modifications—making it particularly useful in CI/CD workflows. Its key capabilities include recursive module analysis, support for both local and remote dependencies, and integration with version control to streamline Terraform-related updates and deployments.

## Action Summary

The `rust-affected` GitHub Action identifies which packages in a Rust workspace are impacted by changes in a repository. It analyzes modified files and the Cargo dependency graph to determine directly changed crates, their transitive dependents, and affected binary targets, while also supporting full workspace rebuilds based on specific trigger files. This helps automate workflows by enabling targeted builds and deployments, saving time and resources in CI/CD pipelines.

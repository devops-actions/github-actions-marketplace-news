## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the validation of version consistency across package management files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) and ensures the local version is higher than the latest published tag based on semantic versioning. It helps maintain version accuracy, detect mismatches, and prevent publishing duplicate or outdated versions, supporting package managers like npm, Cargo, and Poetry. Key capabilities include version comparison, tag validation, and outputting metadata about the version and build state.

The Palisade GitHub Action is an enterprise-grade machine learning model security scanner designed to detect backdoors, supply chain attacks, and malicious payloads before deployment. It automates security checks in CI/CD workflows by leveraging a high-performance Rust core to efficiently validate model integrity, enforce supply chain security standards, and prevent vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and injection attacks. With 15 security validators and support for large models, Palisade provides a robust, zero-trust framework for safeguarding AI/ML pipelines.

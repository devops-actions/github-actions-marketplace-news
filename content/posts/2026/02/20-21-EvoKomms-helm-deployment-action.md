## Action Summary

The Helm Deployment Action is a GitHub Action designed to automate the deployment of Helm charts to Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the management of configurations by enabling the deployment of GitHub Variables and Secrets as Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets, with support for custom environment variables. This action helps streamline complex deployments by allowing the use of structured JSON objects for values, environment-specific configurations, and direct Helm variable assignments, making it easier to manage and scale Kubernetes-based applications.

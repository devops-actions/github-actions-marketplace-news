## Action Summary

The "Repo Token Analysis" GitHub Action analyzes repository token usage against the context limits of popular AI models (e.g., Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) to ensure compatibility and optimize content size. It automates the generation of detailed reports, trend diagnostics, and visual badges to track token usage, identify oversized files, and enforce configurable thresholds for CI workflows. This action helps developers manage AI model context constraints and optimize repositories for efficient AI integration.

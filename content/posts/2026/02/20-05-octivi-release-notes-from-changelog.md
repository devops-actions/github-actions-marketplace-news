- This action is used across all versions by **6** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/extract-release-notes-from-changelog) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action extracts the release notes for a specified version tag from a `CHANGELOG.md` file and saves them to a specified file or outputs them to the console. It automates the process of generating release notes directly from changelogs, streamlining release workflows and ensuring consistency. Key capabilities include a lightweight, dependency-free implementation, compatibility with both GitHub Actions and standalone use, and ease of integration into CI/CD pipelines.

## Action Summary

The **kit-manage** GitHub Action automates the management of Gravwell kits by enabling two key workflows: **Pull**, which synchronizes a kit from a remote Gravwell instance into a git repository via pull requests, and **Push**, which deploys a locally checked-out kit to a remote Gravwell instance. This action streamlines the process of maintaining kit versions between Gravwell and git, helping users automate synchronization and deployment tasks while ensuring efficient integration with Gravwell systems.

Version updated for **https://github.com/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin** to version **v1.8**.
- This action is used across all versions by **351** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Node** action using Node version **24**.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kotlin) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the setup of the Kotlin CLI compiler (`kotlinc`, `kotlin`, `kotlinc-native`) in workflows, enabling users to compile Kotlin source code, run scripts, or build native binaries. It solves the problem of installing specific versions of the Kotlin compiler or providing access to the CLI tools in runners or containers where Kotlin is not preinstalled. The action supports flexible configurations, including the ability to execute Kotlin scripts inline or use Kotlin as a shell.

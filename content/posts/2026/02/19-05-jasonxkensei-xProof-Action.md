Version updated for **https://github.com/jasonxkensei/xProof-Action** to version **v1.2.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/xproof-certify) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The **xProof Certify GitHub Action** automates the process of certifying build artifacts by calculating their SHA-256 hash locally, anchoring the hash on the MultiversX blockchain, and generating verification URLs, badges, and a JSON attestation file for supply chain provenance. This action ensures the integrity and traceability of build artifacts within CI/CD pipelines, solving the problem of unverified builds and enhancing trust in the software delivery process. Key capabilities include blockchain-based certification, artifact verification, and detailed provenance data outputs.

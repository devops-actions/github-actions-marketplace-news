## Action Summary

OpenCache Actions is a fast, configurable caching solution for GitHub Actions workflows, designed as a drop-in replacement for `actions/cache`. It enables users to store CI/CD caches on local disks for self-hosted runners or external storage solutions like S3-compatible object storage and Google Cloud Storage, offering improved pipeline performance and flexibility. With advanced control over cache behavior (e.g., TTL, size limits, compression) and no vendor lock-in, it solves key limitations of the default caching action while maintaining compatibility with existing workflow syntax.

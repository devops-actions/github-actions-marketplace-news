## Action Summary

The Todo Tree Action is a GitHub Action designed to automatically scan pull requests for TODO-style comments (e.g., `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`) and generate a summary that is posted on the pull request. It helps developers identify and track unresolved tasks or potential issues introduced in a PR, offering capabilities such as scanning only changed or new files, adding annotations to matching lines, and optionally failing workflows based on specific conditions. This action streamlines code review and quality assurance processes by automating the detection and reporting of TODO comments.

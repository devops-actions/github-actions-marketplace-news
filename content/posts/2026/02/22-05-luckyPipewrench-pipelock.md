Pipelock is an open-source security tool designed to act as a firewall for AI agents, providing protection against malicious or unintended HTTP requests that could compromise sensitive data such as API keys. It automates the scanning and filtering of network traffic from AI agents using a proxy-based approach, requiring no code changes or SDKs. Key capabilities include data loss prevention (DLP), domain blocklists, and integrity monitoring to secure AI workflows.

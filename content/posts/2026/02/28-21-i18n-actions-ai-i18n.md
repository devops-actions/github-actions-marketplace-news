## Action Summary

The "i18n Translate Action" is a GitHub Action that automates the translation of i18n files using large language models (LLMs) like Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, or Ollama. It supports various file formats (e.g., XLIFF and JSON), detects changes to translate only new or updated strings, and handles complex linguistic nuances like ICU message formats. This action streamlines the localization process by integrating features like batching, rate limiting, and automated Git commits for translated files.

## Release notes

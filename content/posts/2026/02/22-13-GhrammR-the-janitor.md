Version updated for **https://github.com/GhrammR/the-janitor** to version **v6.1.9**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Docker** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/the-janitor-stop-the-slop) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The Janitor is a GitHub Action designed to identify and remove unused code (dead symbols) and duplicate logic across multiple programming languages, including Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C++. It automates static analysis, simulation, and deletion processes to clean up codebases safely while preserving integrity, helping teams reduce technical debt and maintain code health. Additionally, it provides tools like code health badges and audit logs for monitoring and compliance purposes.

## Release notes

# The Janitor: Automated Dead Symbol Detection & Code Cleanup
**Current Version:** v6.1.9

**Stop paying for code you don't use.**

The Janitor creates a Shadow Tree to verify deletion safety, then surgically removes dead code at the symbol level — functions, classes, and entire orphan files — across Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C++ codebases.

Don't guess your technical debt. The Janitor generates a verifiable **Code Health Badge** so your team can surgically monitor the decay of the monolith before it impacts production.

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Static reference graph + 6-stage heuristic pipeline identifies every dead symbol.
2. **Simulate** — Shadow Tree overlays links to the dead files. Your test suite runs against the simulated deletion.
3. **Remove** — Tests pass? Dead code is removed bottom-to-top (byte-precise, UTF-8 hardened). Tests fail? Full rollback, zero corruption.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Free: detect dead code
janitor scan ./src

# Free: find duplicate functions (structural clone detection)
janitor dedup ./src

# Free: simulate + remove (no token required)
janitor clean ./src --force-purge
```

## Language Support

| Language | Dead Functions | Dead Classes | Dead Files | Duplicate Logic |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Python   | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | ✓               |
| Rust     | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | —               |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | ✓ | ✓       | ✓          | —               |
| C++      | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | —               |

## False-Positive Protection

17-variant protection system. Heuristics cover:

- FastAPI route decorators, dependency injection, lifespan teardown
- Pydantic validators, forward references, alias generators
- SQLAlchemy metaprogramming, hybrid properties, polymorphic mappers
- pytest fixtures, conftest.py, test fingerprinting
- Qt auto-connection slots, ORM lifecycle methods
- Plugin directories (Scrapy, Celery, Django management commands)
- Grep shield: Aho-Corasick scan of all non-Python files

## CI Integration

```yaml
- uses: GhrammR/the-janitor@v5
  with:
    path: ./src
    args: scan --verbose
```

For automated cleanup in CI (free):

```yaml
- uses: GhrammR/the-janitor@v5
  with:
    args: clean --force-purge
    path: ./src
```

For signed attestation in CI (Lead Specialist tier):

```yaml
- uses: GhrammR/the-janitor@v5
  with:
    args: clean --force-purge --token ${{ secrets.JANITOR_TOKEN }}
    path: ./src
```

## Action Summary

The `difftrace` GitHub Action is designed to optimize CI workflows in monorepos by detecting changes and identifying affected packages, both directly and transitively, using dependency graphs and `git diff`. It automates the process of determining which packages need to be tested, built, or deployed, eliminating the need to run pipelines for every package on every change. By providing outputs like affected packages and dependency matrices, it enables efficient and targeted CI/CD pipelines, saving time and resources.

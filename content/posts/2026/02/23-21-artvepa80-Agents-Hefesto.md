## Action Summary

Hefesto is an AI-powered code analysis tool that performs static code analysis across multiple programming languages, DevOps/configuration formats, and cloud formats. It identifies issues such as security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, hardcoded secrets), code smells (e.g., high complexity, deep nesting), and other potential errors that traditional linters may miss. The tool integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines via a GitHub Action, enabling automated pre-push validation and providing actionable insights to enhance code quality and security.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the setup of a Fortran development environment using Conda, providing support for multiple Fortran compilers across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. It simplifies the process of installing Fortran, C, and C++ compilers, along with essential build tools like `fpm`, `cmake`, `ninja`, and `meson`, and allows users to specify additional packages. By streamlining these configurations, it addresses the complexity of setting up cross-platform Fortran development workflows for CI/CD pipelines.

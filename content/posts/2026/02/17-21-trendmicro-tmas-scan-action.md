## Action Summary

The TMAS Scan GitHub Action automates the scanning of artifacts, such as files, directories, or container images, for open-source vulnerabilities, malware, and sensitive secrets using the Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS). It helps developers enhance security by identifying potential risks in their codebase or build artifacts, providing detailed scan results in the action logs and summary reports as comments on related pull requests. This action streamlines security checks within CI/CD workflows, reducing the risk of security flaws in software delivery pipelines.

## Release notes

The TMAS CLI download URL has changed from cli.artifactscan.cloudone.trendmicro.com to ast-cli.xdr.trendmicro.com. If your GitHub Enterprise runner uses network allowlists, you must add the new domain before upgrading.

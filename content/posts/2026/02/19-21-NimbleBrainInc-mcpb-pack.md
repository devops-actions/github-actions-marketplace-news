The "MCPB Pack" GitHub Action automates the process of packaging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, along with their dependencies, into portable `.mcpb` bundles. These bundles are then attached to GitHub releases and registered with the `mpak` registry, allowing for easy distribution, discovery, and installation of MCP servers. This action simplifies the deployment workflow for developers by managing the build, packaging, and publishing processes across single or multi-platform environments.

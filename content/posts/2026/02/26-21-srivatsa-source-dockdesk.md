## Action Summary

DockDesk is a local-first semantic documentation auditor that compares code logic against documentation claims to identify and resolve discrepancies, ensuring alignment between the two. It automates tasks such as detecting documentation drift, analyzing inconsistencies, and generating fixes, all while operating entirely on local systems to eliminate privacy risks. Key capabilities include semantic analysis, auto-generated documentation updates, IDE integration, and efficient, fast performance without reliance on cloud APIs or additional infrastructure costs.

## Action Summary

ZIRAN is a security testing tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in AI agents, including those that use tools, retain memory, and perform multi-step reasoning. It automates the analysis of agent-specific attack surfaces, such as tool chain interactions, multi-agent coordination, adaptive attack campaigns, and protocol support. By providing advanced capabilities like knowledge graph tracking, real-time monitoring, and remote agent scanning, ZIRAN addresses unique security challenges in complex AI systems that go beyond traditional LLM and web application testing.

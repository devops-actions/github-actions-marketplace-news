## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, *GitHub Virtual Collaborators*, facilitates collaboration by enabling the use of virtual collaborators (VCs) in Issues and Pull Requests through `@#name` mentions and slash commands. It automates the management of collaboration metadata (e.g., assignees, participants) using GitHub labels or Project fields and provides scoped notifications for better tracking of virtual interactions. The action streamlines workflows for teams operating multiple AI agents or virtual contributors under a single GitHub account.

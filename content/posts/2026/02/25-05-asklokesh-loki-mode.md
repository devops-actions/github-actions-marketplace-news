## Action Summary

Loki Mode is an autonomous multi-agent system designed to transform a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a complete, tested, and production-ready software product. It automates the software development lifecycle by orchestrating specialized agents across various domains (e.g., engineering, operations, and product) to perform tasks such as code generation, testing, and configuration creation, while iteratively verifying outputs for quality. This tool streamlines the development process, reduces manual effort, and ensures code quality through continuous self-verification, serving as an accelerator for projects ranging from simple applications to complex systems.

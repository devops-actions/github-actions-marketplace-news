## Action Summary

The `actions/attest` GitHub Action generates signed attestations for workflow artifacts, ensuring their integrity and provenance using the in-toto format. Powered by Sigstore, it automates the creation, signing, and storage of artifact attestations, providing traceable evidence for build provenance, SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), or custom artifact assertions. This action streamlines artifact verification and enhances supply chain security for both public and private repositories.

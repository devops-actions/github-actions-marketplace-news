## Action Summary

The "Lines Changed Summary Action" is a GitHub Action that automates the process of commenting on pull requests with a detailed breakdown of lines changed, categorized into configurable file groups. It helps developers assess the scope of changes by grouping files (e.g., source code, tests, or generated files) and controlling which groups contribute to the main +/- metric.

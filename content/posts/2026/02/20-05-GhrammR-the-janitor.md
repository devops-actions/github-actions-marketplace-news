Version updated for **https://github.com/GhrammR/the-janitor** to version **v6.0.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Docker** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/the-janitor-stop-the-slop) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The Janitor is a GitHub Action designed to automate the detection and removal of unused or redundant code (dead symbols) at the function, class, and file levels across Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C++ codebases. It ensures deletion safety by simulating the removal process with a "Shadow Tree" and running tests to verify integrity, ultimately improving code quality, reducing bloat, and optimizing maintenance efforts. Additionally, it identifies duplicate logic, provides cleanup reports, and offers optional compliance attestation for CI/CD workflows.

## Release notes

# The Janitor: Automated Dead Symbol Detection & Code Cleanup
**Current Version:** v6.0.0

**Stop paying for code you don't use.**

The Janitor creates a Shadow Tree to verify deletion safety, then surgically removes dead code at the symbol level — functions, classes, and entire orphan files — across Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C++ codebases.

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Static reference graph + 6-stage heuristic pipeline identifies every dead symbol.
2. **Simulate** — Shadow Tree overlays links to the dead files. Your test suite runs against the simulated deletion.
3. **Remove** — Tests pass? Dead code is removed bottom-to-top (byte-precise, UTF-8 hardened). Tests fail? Full rollback, zero corruption.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Free: detect dead code
janitor scan ./src

# Free: find duplicate functions (structural clone detection)
janitor dedup ./src

# Free: simulate + remove (no token required)
janitor clean ./src --force-purge
```

## Language Support

| Language | Dead Functions | Dead Classes | Dead Files | Duplicate Logic |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Python   | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | ✓               |
| Rust     | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | —               |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | ✓ | ✓       | ✓          | —               |
| C++      | ✓             | ✓            | ✓          | —               |

## False-Positive Protection

17-variant protection system. Heuristics cover:

- FastAPI route decorators, dependency injection, lifespan teardown
- Pydantic validators, forward references, alias generators
- SQLAlchemy metaprogramming, hybrid properties, polymorphic mappers
- pytest fixtures, conftest.py, test fingerprinting
- Qt auto-connection slots, ORM lifecycle methods
- Plugin directories (Scrapy, Celery, Django management commands)
- Grep shield: Aho-Corasick scan of all non-Python files

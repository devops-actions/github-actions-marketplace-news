## Action Summary

The `vibe-clock` GitHub Action tracks and visualizes usage statistics for AI coding agents such as Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. It automates the collection and sanitization of session metadata (e.g., token counts, model usage, and activity timelines) and generates customizable charts to showcase coding activity, which can be displayed on a GitHub profile. This tool solves the problem of monitoring and sharing AI coding agent productivity while ensuring user privacy by anonymizing and stripping sensitive data.

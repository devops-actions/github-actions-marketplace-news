## Action Summary

xfg is a GitHub Action and CLI tool that enables organizations to manage files, repository settings, and configurations declaratively across GitHub, Azure DevOps, and GitLab using a single YAML file. It automates tasks such as syncing configuration files, applying repository settings, enforcing rulesets, and managing repositories (e.g., creation, forking, or migration). This streamlines standardization, improves consistency, and reduces manual effort in managing repositories across multiple platforms.

## Action Summary

The "Branch name normalizer" GitHub Action standardizes branch names by converting them into lowercase alphanumeric strings with hyphens, ensuring compliance with the RFC1123 standard. This helps automate the process of preparing branch names for use in contexts such as subdomains, where specific naming conventions are required. It outputs a normalized version of the branch name, solving potential issues with unsupported characters or formats.

## Action Summary

ZIRAN is a security testing tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in AI agents, including those with tools, memory, and multi-step reasoning, rather than focusing solely on LLMs or web applications. It automates tasks such as tool chain analysis, multi-phase attack simulation, and remote scanning of agents over various protocols (REST, OpenAI, A2A, etc.), enabling comprehensive assessments of an AI agent's security posture. Key capabilities include knowledge graph tracking, protocol auto-detection, and support for CI/CD quality gates, making it a robust solution for safeguarding complex AI systems.

## Action Summary

Lingo.dev is an open-source toolkit designed to streamline internationalization (i18n) workflows, particularly for applications using React and related frameworks. It automates tasks such as AI-assisted i18n setup, translation processing for various file formats, runtime dynamic translations, and build-time localization. By providing structured, framework-specific guidance and integration, it addresses common challenges in setting up and managing i18n, reducing errors and inefficiencies in localization processes.

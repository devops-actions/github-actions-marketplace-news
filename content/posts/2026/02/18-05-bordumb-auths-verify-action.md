## Action Summary

The **Auths Verify Action** is a GitHub Action designed to ensure the integrity of commits by verifying their cryptographic signatures using the [Auths](https://github.com/bordumb/auths) identity keys. It automatically checks all commits in a pull request or push to confirm they are signed by authorized developers, helping to prevent unauthorized or unsigned commits in a repository. Key features include automatic commit range detection, support for various verification modes (e.g., allowed signers or identity bundles), detailed failure reporting, and optional posting of results directly to pull requests.

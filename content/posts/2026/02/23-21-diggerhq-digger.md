## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, formerly known as Digger and now rebranded as OpenTaco, enables seamless CI/CD workflows for Terraform and OpenTofu by running infrastructure automation directly within your existing CI system. It eliminates the need for separate CI platforms, providing secure, cost-effective Terraform execution while supporting advanced features like pull request automation, RBAC via Open Policy Agent, drift detection, and PR-level locks. By integrating natively with existing CI environments, it streamlines infrastructure management, reduces complexity, and enhances scalability without sharing sensitive data with third-party services.

## Action Summary

Codeowners Plus is a GitHub Action designed to enhance the functionality of GitHub's native `CODEOWNERS` feature by addressing its limitations. It automates tasks such as smart dismissal of stale reviews, supports more complex ownership rules (e.g., `AND` ownership), allows for directory-level ownership configuration, and provides optional reviewers for non-blocking feedback. This tool enables more granular control over code ownership and review processes, improving collaboration and enforcement in repositories.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action verifies version consistency across package management files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) and ensures that the local version is higher than the latest published tag, following semantic versioning rules. It automates version validation to prevent accidental version conflicts and streamlines release workflows by checking for proper version increments before deployment. The action supports multiple package managers (npm, Cargo, Poetry) and provides outputs like version status and release type.

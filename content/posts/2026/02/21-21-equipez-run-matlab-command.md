## Action Summary

The `equipez/run-matlab-command` GitHub Action enables users to execute MATLAB commands in CI/CD pipelines using MathWorks' `run-matlab-command`. It automates the execution of scripts, supports optional time limits for long-running tasks, and allows a timeout to be treated as a success, making it particularly useful for stress tests. Key capabilities include handling timeouts, generating MATLAB script files, and ensuring the availability of the required MATLAB command-line tool.

## Action Summary

AI Code Gate is a GitHub Action designed to evaluate the quality of pull requests by analyzing cyclomatic complexity, test coverage, and AI anti-pattern density. It automates the process of identifying low-quality, AI-generated code and prevents merging if the code fails to meet predefined quality thresholds. This tool ensures better code quality and reduces risks associated with AI-generated vulnerabilities or inefficiencies.

## Release notes

> **Block low-quality AI-generated code before it merges.**
>
> A GitHub Action that scores every pull request on cyclomatic complexity,
> test coverage, and AI anti-pattern density — and blocks the merge if the
> score drops below your threshold.

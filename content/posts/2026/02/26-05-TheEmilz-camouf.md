## Action Summary

Camouf is a GitHub Action that identifies and resolves errors introduced by AI code generation tools, such as broken contracts, phantom imports, and context drift, which traditional linters and compilers often overlook. It ensures cross-file integrity and architectural consistency, addressing compile-but-fail bugs to improve runtime reliability and maintain codebase coherence. This tool automates the detection and correction of these errors, enhancing the safety and dependability of AI-generated code.

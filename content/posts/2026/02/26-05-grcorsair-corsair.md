## Action Summary

Corsair is a GitHub Action designed to automate the generation and verification of cryptographically signed Certificates of Proof of Operational Effectiveness (CPOEs). It transforms compliance evidence, such as security tool outputs, into machine-readable, verifiable credentials using standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials and Ed25519 signatures. By enabling transparent, provenance-tracked, and easily validated compliance proof, Corsair replaces traditional PDF-based processes, solving issues of inefficiency, unverifiability, and reliance on sender trust.

## Action Summary

The `success-on-timeout` GitHub Action allows users to run commands with a specified time limit and treats timeouts as successful outcomes (exit code `0`) while failing on any errors within the time limit. This is particularly useful for long-running processes, such as stress tests, where a timeout can be considered a pass if the process ran stably for the allotted duration. The action automates the management of time-capped command execution, ensuring workflows remain successful even when commands exceed the time limit.

## Action Summary

Flamecast is a GitHub Action that automates the process of running AI-powered coding agents on existing GitHub infrastructure. It enables users to describe coding tasks in natural language, which are then executed by Claude Code, resulting in pull requests with proposed changes. By orchestrating compute, code hosting, secret management, and review processes already available in GitHub, Flamecast eliminates the need for third-party services and simplifies the management of background coding tasks without requiring additional infrastructure setup or trust boundaries.

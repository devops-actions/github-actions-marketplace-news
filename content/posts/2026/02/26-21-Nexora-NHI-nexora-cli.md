## Action Summary

The `nexora-cli` is an open-source command-line tool designed to identify Non-Human Identity (NHI) risks in GitHub Actions workflows, Kubernetes manifests, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) files like Terraform. By statically detecting misconfigurations such as unpinned actions, hardcoded secrets, and overly permissive policies, it helps prevent security incidents involving service accounts and machine credentials. The tool operates locally, requires no external dependencies or accounts, and provides actionable insights to enhance security posture.

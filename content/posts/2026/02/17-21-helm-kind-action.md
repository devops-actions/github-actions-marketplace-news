## Action Summary

The *Kind Action* is a GitHub Action designed to automate the creation and management of local Kubernetes clusters using Kubernetes-IN-Docker (Kind). It simplifies testing Kubernetes environments by spinning up clusters during workflows, such as pull requests, and supports features like configuring a local Docker registry within the cluster. This action is ideal for streamlining development, testing, and validation of Kubernetes-based applications in CI/CD pipelines.

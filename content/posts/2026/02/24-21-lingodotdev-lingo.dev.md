Lingo.dev is an open-source internationalization (i18n) toolkit designed to streamline and automate localization tasks, particularly for React applications. It provides tools such as an AI-enhanced MCP for error-free i18n setups, CLI utilities for translating various file formats, CI/CD integration for automated translation pipelines, and SDKs/compilers for runtime and build-time localization. By addressing common pitfalls in i18n implementation, it simplifies complex workflows and ensures reliable, scalable localization across projects.

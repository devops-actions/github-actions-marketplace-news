## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, "Bump Version by Labels," automates the process of incrementing a project's version number based on semantic versioning by interpreting pull request labels (e.g., major, minor, patch). It creates a version bump pull request, generates a corresponding Git tag when merged, and optionally creates a GitHub Release. This action streamlines version management and tagging, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency in release processes.

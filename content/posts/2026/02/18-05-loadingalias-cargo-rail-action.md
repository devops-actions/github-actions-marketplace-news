## Action Summary

The `cargo-rail-action` GitHub Action integrates the `cargo rail plan` command into CI pipelines to automate the analysis of code changes and determine which jobs (e.g., build, test, docs) should execute. It solves the problem of unnecessary CI workflows by using deterministic "gates" based on file changes, ensuring alignment between local and CI environments. Key capabilities include publishing granular job gating outputs, dynamic job matrices, and supporting configurable workflows for efficient and targeted CI processes.

## Action Summary

The **Lint i18n** GitHub Action is designed to validate flat-key i18n JSON files by detecting structural errors such as namespace conflicts, invalid value types, malformed JSON, and empty files. It automates the process of ensuring i18n files follow best practices and provides clear, line-specific annotations for errors directly in GitHub pull request reviews. This helps developers maintain consistent, error-free localization files and avoid runtime issues with common i18n libraries.

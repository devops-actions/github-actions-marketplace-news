## Action Summary

The "agent-bom" GitHub Action is an AI-focused Bill of Materials generator designed to automate the discovery and analysis of vulnerabilities (CVEs) in AI agents and MCP servers. It maps the blast radius of security risks, identifies exposed credentials, analyzes attacker tool access, detects privilege issues, and provides enterprise-level remediation insights. By integrating frameworks like OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS, and NIST AI RMF, it equips users with actionable insights to manage and mitigate risks in AI systems effectively, addressing gaps in traditional vulnerability scanners.

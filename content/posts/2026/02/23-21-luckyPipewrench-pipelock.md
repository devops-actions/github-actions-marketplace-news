## Action Summary

Pipelock is an open-source agent firewall designed to monitor and secure HTTP requests made by AI agents, preventing unauthorized data exfiltration or malicious activity. It operates as a lightweight proxy that scans outbound traffic for risks such as leaked API keys, domain blocklists, and data integrity violations, without requiring changes to the agent's code. This tool automates the enforcement of security policies for AI agents, ensuring safer interactions with external services.

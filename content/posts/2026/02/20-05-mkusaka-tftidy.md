## Action Summary

The `tftidy` GitHub Action automates the cleanup of Terraform configuration files by removing transient blocks (`moved`, `removed`, and `import`) that are no longer needed after refactoring or state operations. It ensures configurations remain tidy and consistent by scanning directories recursively, preserving file structure, and applying HCL formatting. This action simplifies maintenance of Terraform codebases and integrates seamlessly into CI/CD workflows.

## Action Summary

The "xProof Certify" GitHub Action automates the certification of build artifacts by calculating their SHA-256 hash, anchoring the hash on the MultiversX blockchain, and generating attestation data for verification. It solves the problem of supply chain security by providing immutable proof of artifact provenance, enabling developers to authenticate their builds and prevent unauthorized claims. Key capabilities include generating verification URLs, badges, and JSON attestation files for integration into CI/CD pipelines.

## Release notes

What's changed :

Positioning alignment
- Updated description field to reflect canonical positioning: "Proof primitive for AI agents and humans on MultiversX"
- Fixed GitHub Marketplace rendering issue where & was stripped — now uses and for reliable display

Why this matters
This is a branding-only update. No functional changes.

## Action Summary

BreakPoint AI is a GitHub Action designed to automate the detection and prevention of risky changes to large language model (LLM) outputs before deployment. It evaluates modifications to prompts or models by comparing new outputs against a stored baseline, identifying issues like cost increases, PII leaks, or output format regressions that traditional unit tests might miss. This ensures teams can confidently ship LLM updates while maintaining cost control, data privacy, and output integrity.

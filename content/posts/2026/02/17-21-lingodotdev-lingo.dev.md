## Action Summary

Lingo.dev is an open-source internationalization (i18n) toolkit designed to simplify and automate localization workflows for developers, particularly in projects using React and modern frameworks like Next.js. It provides tools such as an AI-assisted MCP for reliable i18n setup, a CLI for translating various file formats, CI/CD integrations for automated translation pipelines, and SDK/Compiler solutions for runtime and build-time localization.

Version updated for **https://github.com/PeterGrace/codeowner-gen** to version **v0.4.3**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

## Action Type
This is a **Composite** action.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/codeowner-gen) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The `codeowner-gen` GitHub Action automates the generation and maintenance of `CODEOWNERS` files by transforming a structured YAML configuration (`codeowners.yaml`) into a properly formatted, column-aligned, and optionally grouped output. It simplifies code review processes by ensuring consistent formatting, alphabetization, and grouping in the `CODEOWNERS` file, allowing reviewers to focus on meaningful changes in the YAML configuration instead of formatting inconsistencies. This action is particularly useful for teams aiming to streamline ownership management and maintain clean and readable repository structures.

## Release notes

I didn't follow my own process for updating version numbers and as a result v0.4.1 landed with the binary still thinking it was v0.3.2.  Shame!

## Action Summary

AgentShield is a security scanning tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in AI agent extensions, such as those for MCP servers, LangChain tools, and CrewAI agents, before deployment. It automates static code analysis using advanced detection mechanisms, including cross-file validation, to identify risks like command injection, credential exfiltration, and SSRF, producing SARIF reports compatible with GitHub Code Scanning. It operates offline, supports multiple frameworks, and provides a seamless integration as a Rust-based GitHub Action or standalone CLI tool.

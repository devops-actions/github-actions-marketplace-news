This GitHub Action automates the process of managing stale issues and pull requests by identifying those with no activity for a specified period, labeling them as "Stale," and closing them after a further period of inactivity. It helps maintain cleaner repositories by reducing the clutter of inactive issues and PRs, while also allowing for reactivation if activity resumes.

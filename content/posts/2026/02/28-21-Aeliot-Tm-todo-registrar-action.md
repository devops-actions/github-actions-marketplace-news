## Action Summary

The TODO Registrar Action is a GitHub Action designed to scan codebases for TODO or FIXME comments and automatically convert them into issues in supported issue trackers like GitHub, GitLab, or JIRA. It prevents duplicate issues by injecting issue IDs back into the code comments and commits these changes to the repository, eliminating the need for external databases. This automation simplifies tracking and managing TODOs directly within the development workflow.

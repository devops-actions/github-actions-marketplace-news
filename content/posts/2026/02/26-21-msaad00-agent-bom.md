## Action Summary

Agent-bom is an AI supply chain security scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities (CVEs) in packages and images while assessing security risks such as credential exposure, tool access, and privilege escalation. It automates the mapping of blast radius from vulnerabilities to compromised AI agents, credentials, and tools, offering comprehensive risk assessments and compliance with frameworks like OWASP, MITRE, and NIST. Its advanced capabilities include malicious package detection, enterprise-level remediation insights, and enriched security metrics, addressing critical gaps in traditional vulnerability scanners.

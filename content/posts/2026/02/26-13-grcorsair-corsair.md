## Action Summary

Corsair is a GitHub Action designed to automate the creation, signing, and verification of machine-readable, cryptographically verifiable certificates called Certificates of Proof of Operational Effectiveness (CPOEs). By converting traditional, non-verifiable compliance documents (e.g., SOC 2 reports, pentest results) into verifiable credentials using W3C standards and Ed25519 signatures, it ensures trust and transparency in compliance reporting. This action simplifies and secures evidence validation, enabling organizations to prove the effectiveness of their operational controls without relying on manual processes or trust in the sender.

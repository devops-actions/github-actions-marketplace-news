## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, formerly known as Digger and now OpenTaco, automates Terraform and OpenTofu workflows by natively running them within your existing CI/CD pipeline. It eliminates the need for separate infrastructure-as-code CI systems like Atlantis or Terraform Cloud, enhancing security by keeping secrets within your CI and reducing costs by leveraging existing compute resources. Key features include PR-level locks, RBAC with Open Policy Agent, drift detection, and support for advanced Terraform workflows, providing a streamlined and scalable solution for managing infrastructure as code.

## Release notes

## Digger Backend (Enterprise Edition) v0.1.7.29

Terraform orchestration service with advanced features and multi-VCS support.

## Action Summary

The `gen-pr` GitHub Action and CLI tool automates the creation of pull requests by leveraging AI (Large Language Models) to translate GitHub issues into working code. It simplifies development workflows by allowing developers to focus on writing issues, while the AI generates implementation plans and code using various AI coding tools such as OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini. This tool reduces manual coding effort, improves productivity, and is highly flexible, functioning both as a standalone CLI and a GitHub Action.

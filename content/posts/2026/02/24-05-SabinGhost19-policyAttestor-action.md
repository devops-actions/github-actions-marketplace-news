## Action Summary

The **ZTA Policy Attestor** GitHub Action enhances Zero-Trust supply chain security by cryptographically binding infrastructure and runtime security policies to Docker images. It automates the conversion of a developer-friendly YAML security policy into a strict JSON format, attaches it as an in-toto attestation using Sigstore Cosign, and stores it in an OCI registry. This ensures that Kubernetes Admission Controllers or Operators can verify the attestation at deployment, preventing runtime drift and unauthorized privilege escalation.

## Action Summary

The "Azure Container Apps Build and Deploy" GitHub Action automates the deployment of application source code to Azure Container Apps directly from a GitHub workflow. It simplifies the process by supporting various input options, including a pre-built container image, a Dockerfile, or raw application source code, which can be automatically built into a runnable image using the Oryx++ Builder. This action streamlines the containerization and deployment workflow, eliminating the need for manual image building and deployment configuration.

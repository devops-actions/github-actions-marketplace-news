## Action Summary

Stack-Scout is an automated codebase analysis tool designed to detect programming languages, frameworks, build systems, package managers, and DevOps tooling used in software projects. It streamlines the process of understanding and documenting a project's technology stack by scanning repositories and configuration files to generate detailed, auditable reports in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. This tool is particularly useful for developers and teams looking to automate project analysis and integrate insights into CI/CD workflows.

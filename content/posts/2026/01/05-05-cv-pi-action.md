## Action Summary

The `pi-action` GitHub Action automates interactions with the `pi coding agent` to assist with issue handling, pull request reviews, and other repository tasks, triggered by customizable commands (e.g., `@pi`) in comments or upon issue/PR creation. It enhances collaboration by enabling automated code reviews, enforcing commit conventions, and integrating with large language models (LLMs) for intelligent responses, while providing robust security controls and bot allowlists. The action streamlines workflow automation and eliminates the need for separate installations by directly utilizing the `pi SDK`.

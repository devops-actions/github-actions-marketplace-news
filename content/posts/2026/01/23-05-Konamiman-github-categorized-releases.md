## Action Summary

GitHub Categorized Releases is a GitHub Action and Node.js script that automates the creation of a categorized, hierarchical release site for monorepos or repositories with multiple related projects. It organizes releases into customizable categories and subcategories using regex-based matching and publishes the static site to GitHub Pages. This action solves the problem of managing flat, unorganized release lists by enabling structured navigation, persistence, and improved usability for repositories with complex release structures.

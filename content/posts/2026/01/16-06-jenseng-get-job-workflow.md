## Action Summary

The `get-job-workflow` GitHub Action retrieves detailed information about the workflow file that defines the currently running job, such as its SHA, ref, path, and repository. This is particularly useful for reusable workflows that need to understand their invocation context, enabling tasks like running actions or accessing files from the same reference without relying on hardcoded values. By automating the extraction of this data, it addresses limitations in GitHub's native context variables and enhances workflow flexibility and resilience.

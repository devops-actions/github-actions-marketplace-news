## Action Summary

The `nixpkgs-updater` GitHub Action automates the process of updating Nix package files in a centralized repository when a new version of a package is released in a source repository. It updates fields such as `version`, `rev`, and hash values, supports both modern and legacy hash formats, and can handle complex cases like Go modules with `vendorHash`. Additionally, it automates the creation and updating of pull requests for version bumps, streamlining package maintenance workflows.

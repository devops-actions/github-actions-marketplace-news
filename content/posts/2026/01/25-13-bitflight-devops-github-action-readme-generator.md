## Action Summary

The GitHub Action "GitHub Action's Readme Generator" automates the synchronization of an action's `action.yml` file with its `README.md` documentation. It generates and updates sections for inputs, outputs, and usage examples in the README to ensure consistency with the action's code. This tool reduces manual effort in maintaining accurate documentation and supports both CLI and GitHub Action workflows.

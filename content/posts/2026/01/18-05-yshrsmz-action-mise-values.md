Version updated for **https://github.com/yshrsmz/action-mise-values** to version **v0.2.1**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/read-mise-toml-versions) to find the latest changes.

## Action Summary

The `action-mise-values` GitHub Action reads the `[tools]` table from a `mise.toml` file and outputs it as a JSON object, enabling seamless integration of tool versions into subsequent workflow steps. It provides a centralized way to manage tool versions (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go) without hardcoding them in workflows, allowing users to leverage official setup actions for caching, tool-specific features, and granular control. This action is read-only and focuses on simplifying version management and automation in CI/CD pipelines.

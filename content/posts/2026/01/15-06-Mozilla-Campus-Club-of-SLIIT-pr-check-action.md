## Action Summary

The PR Policy Checker GitHub Action automates the validation of pull requests to ensure they comply with project guidelines. It checks for proper closing statements, verifies that all required checkboxes are marked, and ensures pull requests originate from non-default branches. This helps maintain consistent standards, streamline code reviews, and prevent common errors in pull request submissions.

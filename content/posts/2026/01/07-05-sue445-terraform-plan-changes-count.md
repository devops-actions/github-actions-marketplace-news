## Action Summary

The `terraform-plan-changes-count` GitHub Action analyzes a Terraform plan file to count the number of resource changes (create, update, delete) and provides these counts as outputs. It automates the process of quantifying infrastructure modifications, helping users assess the impact of changes and integrate this validation into CI/CD workflows. This action is especially useful for tasks like conditional logic in pipelines, such as auto-merging pull requests when no infrastructure changes are detected.

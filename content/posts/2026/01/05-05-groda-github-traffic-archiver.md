## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the collection and archival of repository traffic statistics (clones and views), addressing GitHub’s 14-day data retention limit by storing metrics in a dedicated repository for long-term historical analysis. It streamlines the process by fetching daily traffic data, updating logs, and maintaining a centralized "Metrics Vault" for tracking multiple repositories. This solution ensures data persistence, centralizes analytics, and prevents clutter in source code repositories.

## Action Summary

QWED is a model-agnostic verification tool designed to evaluate and validate outputs from any large language model (LLM), such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models. Its primary purpose is to detect and prevent AI hallucinations by using eight specialized verification engines, ensuring that only provable and reliable AI outputs are allowed into production. QWED automates the verification process, providing a robust layer of trust for AI-generated content without requiring modification to the underlying models.

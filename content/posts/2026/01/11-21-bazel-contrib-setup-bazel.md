## Action Summary

The `setup-bazel` GitHub Action automates the setup and configuration of Bazelisk and Bazel across different operating systems, ensuring efficient and consistent builds in CI/CD workflows. It provides advanced caching mechanisms to optimize performance by reducing redundant downloads and enabling shared or workflow-specific build caches. This action simplifies Bazel integration, improves build speeds, and supports fine-grained caching for external repositories and build artifacts.

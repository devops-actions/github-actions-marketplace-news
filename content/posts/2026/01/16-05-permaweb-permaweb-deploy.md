## Action Summary

The `permaweb-deploy` GitHub Action is a Node.js tool designed to automate the deployment of web applications to the permaweb using the Arweave blockchain. It simplifies the process by uploading files or build folders, generating Arweave manifests, and updating ArNS records with transaction IDs, supporting continuous deployment workflows.

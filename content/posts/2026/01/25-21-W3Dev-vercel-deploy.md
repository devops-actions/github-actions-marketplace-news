## Action Summary

The **Vercel Deploy Action** is a GitHub Action designed to deploy preview and production environments to Vercel with enhanced build control and automation. It allows users to build projects on GitHub Actions runners instead of Vercel’s infrastructure, enabling advanced customization, monorepo support, stable preview URLs, and streamlined PR comment management. This action is ideal for scenarios where greater flexibility, compliance, or integration with complex workflows is required, solving limitations of Vercel's native GitHub integration.

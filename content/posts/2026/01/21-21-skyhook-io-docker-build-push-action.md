## Action Summary

The **Docker Build and Push Action** is a streamlined wrapper around Docker's `build-push-action` that automates the process of building and pushing Docker images to container registries. It solves common challenges by simplifying configuration, automatically generating tags (e.g., SHA, latest), supporting multi-architecture builds, and ensuring input validation to prevent errors. Additionally, it enhances security with SBOM and provenance support and provides detailed build summaries for better traceability.

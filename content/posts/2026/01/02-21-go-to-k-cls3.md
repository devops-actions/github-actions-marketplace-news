## Action Summary

The `cls3` GitHub Action is a CLI tool designed to automate the process of managing Amazon S3 buckets by providing functionality to empty, delete, or manage multiple buckets at once. It simplifies tasks such as clearing buckets with versioning enabled, searching for and managing buckets across regions, and selectively deleting old object versions while retaining the latest ones. Additionally, it supports integration with S3-compatible storage systems through custom endpoint URLs, enhancing flexibility for various use cases.

## Action Summary

The **Test MC Runtime** GitHub Action allows users to run a Minecraft client within CI/CD pipelines, automating the testing of runtime bugs in Minecraft mods across multiple versions and modloaders. It simplifies the previously manual task of launching and testing Minecraft environments by utilizing tools like HeadlessMC and Xvfb, enabling headless execution of the client, automated world loading, and integration with Minecraft’s GameTest Framework for structured test execution. This action is particularly useful for mod developers who need to ensure compatibility and identify runtime issues efficiently.

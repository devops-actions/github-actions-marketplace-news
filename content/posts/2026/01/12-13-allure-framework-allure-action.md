## Action Summary

The Allure Action is a GitHub Action designed to automate the generation and posting of Allure Report summaries directly within pull requests. It analyzes test result data, provides statistics (such as new, flaky, and retried tests), and includes links to remote reports hosted on the Allure Service if configured. This action streamlines test reporting and enhances collaboration by making test results easily accessible and integrated into the code review process.

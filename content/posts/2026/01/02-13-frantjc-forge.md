## Action Summary

Forge is a library and CLI tool designed to streamline the process of transitioning between CI systems by enabling reusable steps from various proprietary CI platforms to be run through a pluggable container runtime. It solves the problem of incompatibility and inefficiency when switching CI systems, allowing users to test or consume GitHub Actions and other CI functionalities more flexibly across different environments.

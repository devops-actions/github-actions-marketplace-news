The `semantic-issue-action` is a GitHub Action designed to ensure that issue titles in a repository adhere to the Conventional Commits specification. It automates the validation of issue titles and posts comments on issues with non-compliant titles, helping maintain consistent and semantic formatting in project management. Additionally, it provides output on whether an issue title passes the validation, enabling further workflow customization.

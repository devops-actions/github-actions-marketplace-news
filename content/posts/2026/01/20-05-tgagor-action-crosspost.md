## Action Summary

The **action-crosspost** GitHub Action automates the process of sharing your latest content to multiple social media platforms directly from GitHub. It retrieves URLs from a sitemap or RSS/Atom feed, filters them based on criteria like age or patterns, and posts them to configured networks such as Twitter/X, Mastodon, or LinkedIn. This action simplifies content promotion, saves time, and ensures efficient crossposting with features like metadata-based message templates, dry-run mode for safe testing, and customizable failure handling.

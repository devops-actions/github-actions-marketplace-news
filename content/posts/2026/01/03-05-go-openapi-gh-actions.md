## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, maintained by the `go-openapi` project, provides reusable workflows and tools to automate tasks in CI/CD pipelines, such as installing and managing specific versions of tools like `gotestsum`, `go-junit-report`, and others. It addresses the need for consistent and pinned dependencies in CI workflows by installing vetted tool versions directly from binary releases and ensuring they pass vulnerability scans. Additionally, it offers specialized actions like `wait-pending-jobs` to handle timing issues in workflows, ensuring all jobs are completed before merging pull requests.

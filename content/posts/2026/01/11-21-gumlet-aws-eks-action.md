## Action Summary

The `setup-aws-eks` GitHub Action simplifies connecting to an AWS EKS cluster within a GitHub Actions workflow by automatically creating or updating the Kubernetes configuration file (`.kube/config`) to enable access to the cluster. It automates the setup process for Kubernetes clients, such as the `kubectl` CLI, ensuring seamless integration and management of deployments on EKS. This action is particularly useful for streamlining Kubernetes configuration and cluster access in CI/CD pipelines.

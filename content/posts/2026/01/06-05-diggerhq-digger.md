## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, formerly known as Digger and now rebranded as OpenTaco, provides CI/CD automation for Terraform and OpenTofu by integrating seamlessly with your existing CI infrastructure. It eliminates the need for separate CI systems by running Terraform natively within your CI, enhancing security, reducing costs, and offering features such as pull request-level locks, Open Policy Agent (OPA) support, drift detection, and Terraform plan/apply automation. This action is designed to simplify infrastructure-as-code workflows, improve scalability, and ensure sensitive data stays within your CI environment.

## Action Summary

Palisade is a GitHub Action designed to enhance the security of machine learning models by scanning them for backdoors, supply chain attacks, and malicious payloads before deployment. It automates model validation, integrity checks, and supply chain verification using a high-performance Rust core for efficient handling of large models, ensuring a zero-trust approach to model security. Key capabilities include detecting remote code execution, tampering, and injection attacks, while supporting compliance with standards like Sigstore and SLSA.

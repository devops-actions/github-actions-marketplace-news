## Action Summary

The BoringCache Rust GitHub Action simplifies and speeds up Rust-based CI/CD workflows by automating the setup of the Rust environment and caching key build artifacts, including the Rust toolchain, cargo dependencies, and target directories. It ensures efficient, manifest-aware cache reuse, verified restores, and platform-safe caching to reduce redundant uploads, improve build times, and support consistent development environments across local, CI, and Docker setups.

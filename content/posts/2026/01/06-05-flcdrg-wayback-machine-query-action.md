## Action Summary

This GitHub Action integrates with Archive.org's Wayback Machine to automatically find archived versions of broken URLs. It processes input files (e.g., generated by link-checking tools like Lychee) and outputs a JSON file containing a list of missing URLs and replacements with corresponding archived links. This action streamlines fixing broken links in web content, improving accessibility and reducing manual effort in link recovery tasks.

- This action is used across all versions by **35** repositories.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action verifies that the version specified in your project files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `pyproject.toml`) is consistent across files and higher than the latest published Git tag, following semantic versioning (semver) rules. It automates version validation for projects using npm, Cargo, or Poetry, ensuring version control accuracy and preventing accidental version downgrades or mismatches. Key capabilities include detecting prerelease versions, identifying if the current version is new, and supporting custom tag filtering using regex.

## Action Summary

The `job-context` GitHub Action enhances the default job context provided by GitHub Actions by adding key details such as the rendered job name and numeric job ID used by the GitHub API. It automates the retrieval of these additional job metadata, solving the limitation of missing information in the default `job` context. This action is particularly useful for workflows requiring precise identification or debugging of jobs within a workflow.

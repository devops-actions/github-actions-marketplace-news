## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, `jd`, is a tool for diffing and patching JSON and YAML files. It simplifies comparison and merging by generating minimal, human-readable differences, and supports multiple patch formats, including JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386) and a subset of JSON Patch (RFC 6902).

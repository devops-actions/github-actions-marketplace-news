## Action Summary

The `terraform-version` GitHub Action determines the appropriate version of Terraform and its providers for a given root module by analyzing various configuration sources such as `required_version`, `.tfswitchrc`, `.terraform-version`, and workspace settings. It automates the process of version discovery, ensuring compatibility and consistency across workflows. This action is particularly useful for managing Terraform versioning dynamically and outputs the determined versions for use in subsequent workflow steps.

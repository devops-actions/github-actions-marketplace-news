## Action Summary

Early-Catch is a GitHub Action that automates the generation of unit tests for TypeScript and JavaScript code changes in pull requests. It identifies uncovered functions in changed files, generates valid tests (ensuring no errors or failing specs), and commits them directly to the source branch. This action streamlines test creation, improves code coverage, and ensures pull requests are accompanied by reliable, auto-generated tests.

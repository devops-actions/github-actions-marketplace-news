## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates semantic versioning and release management by analyzing commit messages that follow the Conventional Commit standard. It calculates version increments (major, minor, patch) based on commit types (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and creates releases, including assets, directly on the repository's main or master branch. This simplifies release workflows, ensures consistent versioning, and eliminates manual intervention in release processes.

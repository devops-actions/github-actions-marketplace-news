## Action Summary

Palisade is a GitHub Action designed for enterprise-grade security scanning of machine learning models to detect backdoors, supply chain attacks, and other malicious payloads before deployment. It automates tasks such as verifying model integrity, enforcing supply chain security standards (e.g., Sigstore and SLSA), and preventing injection attacks, enabling a zero-trust approach to model validation. Powered by a high-performance Rust core, it efficiently handles large-scale models, ensuring robust, fast, and memory-efficient security analysis within CI/CD workflows.

## Action Summary

Semantic Firewall is a GitHub Action designed to detect and prevent logic corruption in Go code by analyzing its semantic behavior rather than its syntax. It automates the identification of hidden logic changes, such as backdoors or unintended side effects, even in cases where traditional tools like unit tests or Git diffs fail. Key capabilities include generating deterministic behavior fingerprints, performing semantic diffs to isolate meaningful changes, and enforcing semantic integrity in CI/CD pipelines to enhance code security and maintain refactoring safety.

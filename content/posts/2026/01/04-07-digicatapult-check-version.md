## Action Summary

This GitHub Action compares the version in project files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `pyproject.toml`) with the latest published tag to ensure the local version is higher, following semantic versioning rules. It automates the validation of version consistency across files and ensures versioning aligns with release practices, helping prevent accidental downgrades or version conflicts. The action supports multiple package managers (npm, Cargo, Poetry) and provides outputs like version information, build date, and release type.

## Action Summary

The `require-approved-issue` GitHub Action enforces an "issue-first" contribution workflow by requiring external contributors to reference an approved GitHub issue in their pull requests. It automates the process of ensuring that proposed changes are discussed and approved by maintainers before a PR can proceed, either by closing unapproved PRs or marking them with a failing status check. This helps maintainers manage contributions more effectively, avoiding unapproved or unexpected work while maintaining flexibility with configurable enforcement modes.

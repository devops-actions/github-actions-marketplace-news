## Action Summary

The "Azure Pipelines Dependency Submission" GitHub Action automates the process of analyzing Azure Pipelines configuration files to detect task dependencies and submits them to GitHub's Dependency Graph. This enables vulnerability scanning and Dependabot alerts for Azure Pipelines tasks, helping users identify and address security risks in their CI/CD pipelines. Key features include automatic discovery of pipeline files, resolution of task templates, and integration with Azure DevOps and GitHub for enhanced dependency management.

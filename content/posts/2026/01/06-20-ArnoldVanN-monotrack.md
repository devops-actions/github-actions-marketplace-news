## Action Summary

Monotrack is a GitHub Action designed to streamline versioning and dependency tracking for monorepos, offering a lightweight solution that avoids the complexity of larger tools like release-please or release-it. It automates tasks such as identifying and tagging changes across projects and executing actions only for modified components, making it particularly useful for managing pre-releases and development workflows in monorepos. Key capabilities include specifying dependency trees, comparing changes between commits, and generating outputs of affected projects for efficient CI/CD processes.

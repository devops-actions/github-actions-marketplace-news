## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates version management by comparing the version numbers in package files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) with the latest published tags. It ensures consistency across version files and verifies that the local version is higher than the most recent published version, helping to prevent versioning errors in package releases. It supports multiple package managers (npm, Cargo, Poetry) and provides outputs like whether the version is new, the current version, build date, and release tag status.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action simplifies and secures Terraform and OpenTofu workflows by running Terraform natively within your existing CI/CD pipeline, eliminating the need for separate infrastructure or third-party CI systems. It automates tasks like Terraform plan/apply via pull request comments, drift detection, and RBAC enforcement, while providing features such as PR-level locks and integration with tools like Terragrunt and Checkov. By leveraging your CI's compute environment, it enhances security, reduces costs, and streamlines infrastructure management.

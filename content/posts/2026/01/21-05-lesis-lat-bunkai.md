## Action Summary

Bunkai is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool for Perl projects that parses `cpanfile` to identify, analyze, and manage dependencies. It helps improve build security and stability by detecting missing version specifications, identifying outdated or vulnerable dependencies, and providing remediation suggestions. Additionally, it integrates with GitHub Actions to automate dependency and security analysis, with SARIF output for GitHub Advanced Security.

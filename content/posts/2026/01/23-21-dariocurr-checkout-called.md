## Action Summary

The `checkout-called` GitHub Action automates the process of checking out the repository referenced in a reusable workflow at the same reference (branch, tag, or commit) it was invoked with. It simplifies repository management in reusable workflows by automatically injecting the appropriate `ref` and `repository` values, reducing manual configuration. This action ensures compatibility with `actions/checkout` and streamlines workflow execution.

## Action Summary

The Qubic Contract Verification Tool is a GitHub Action that automates the validation of C++ files to ensure compliance with Qubic's smart contract-specific C++ language restrictions. It streamlines the process of verifying contract code during CI workflows, reducing the risk of non-compliant code being deployed. The action leverages a Docker-based container to perform checks on specified files, supporting automated and consistent validation.

## Action Summary

The **SSM Parameter Store Env Loader** is a GitHub Action designed to fetch parameters from AWS SSM Parameter Store and either export them as environment variables or save them to an environment file (e.g., `.env`). It automates the secure retrieval and decryption of secrets, simplifies parameter management by trimming paths to base names, and ensures sensitive values are masked in logs. This action is ideal for integrating AWS-managed secrets into CI/CD workflows.

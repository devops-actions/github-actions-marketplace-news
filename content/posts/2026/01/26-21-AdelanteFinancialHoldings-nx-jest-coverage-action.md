## Action Summary

The NX Jest Coverage Action is a GitHub Action designed to generate Jest test coverage reports for affected projects in NX workspaces and post them as comments on pull requests. It automates the detection of impacted projects, calculates coverage metrics, and presents results with color-coded badges, helping teams track and visualize code coverage changes efficiently in monorepos. This action streamlines test coverage monitoring while reducing PR comment clutter by updating existing reports.

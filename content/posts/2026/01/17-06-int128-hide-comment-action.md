## Action Summary

The **hide-comment-action** GitHub Action automates the process of hiding (minimizing) specific comments in pull requests, particularly those created by the `github-actions` user. It allows users to define conditions such as comment author, or body content (e.g., starts with, ends with, or contains specific text) for selective hiding, helping to declutter pull request discussions and improve focus on relevant feedback. This tool is especially useful for managing automated comments in CI/CD workflows.

## Action Summary

IntelliTester is a GitHub Action that leverages AI, iOS/Android emulators, and web browsers to automate the creation and execution of test suites based on simple instructions. It streamlines testing workflows by generating and running tests, debugging failures with tools like Playwright Inspector, and automatically cleaning up resources after execution to maintain a clean testing environment. Key capabilities include YAML-based test configuration with schema validation, real-time debugging, and customizable resource cleanup for common backends like databases and APIs.

## Action Summary

The **Easy NPM Publish** GitHub Action automates the process of versioning, tagging, and publishing npm packages using commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits standard. It determines the next semantic version, updates Git tags, and publishes the package to an npm-compatible registry, streamlining the release workflow and ensuring consistent versioning. This action eliminates the need for manual version updates and tagging, saving time and reducing errors.

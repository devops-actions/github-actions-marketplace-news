## Action Summary

The GitHub Action `positionless` is a static analysis tool for Go that detects and suggests converting positional struct literal initializations to named field initializations. It automates the process of identifying and fixing fragile code patterns caused by positional struct literals, improving code maintainability and reducing bugs when struct fields are reordered or modified. Key capabilities include integration with `go vet`, CI/CD pipelines, and compatibility with tools like `golangci-lint` for seamless code quality enforcement.

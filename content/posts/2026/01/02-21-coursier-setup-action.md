## Action Summary

The **Coursier setup GitHub Action** automates the installation of Coursier, a tool for managing JVM and Scala-related dependencies, along with specific versions of Java, Scala CLI tools, and build tools such as `mill` or `sbt`. It simplifies setting up a consistent development environment across platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) by providing a streamlined way to install JVMs, Scala apps, and custom repositories. This action is ideal for projects requiring a specific JVM or Scala toolchain, reducing setup complexity and ensuring reproducibility.

## Action Summary

The **Multiple Codeowners Action** automates the process of combining multiple `CODEOWNERS` files from different parts of a repository into a single consolidated file. This is particularly useful for large projects with distributed code ownership, as it simplifies the management of ownership definitions and reduces duplication. The action ensures a unified `CODEOWNERS` file is generated to improve maintainability and streamline repository management.

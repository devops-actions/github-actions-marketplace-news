## Action Summary

Monotrack is a lightweight GitHub Action designed for managing versioning in monorepos, particularly for creating pre-release or development tags and identifying which projects have changed between commits. It automates the process of tracking changes across multiple projects within a monorepo and ensures that only relevant actions, such as builds or tests, are executed for the affected components. This tool provides a simpler and more customizable alternative to heavier versioning tools like release-please or release-it.

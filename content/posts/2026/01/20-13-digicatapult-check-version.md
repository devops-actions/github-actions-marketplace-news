## Action Summary

This GitHub Action checks and validates version consistency across package management files (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) and ensures the specified version is higher than the latest published Git tag according to semantic versioning rules. It automates version control validation, preventing version mismatches and ensuring proper version progression for package releases. Key capabilities include cross-manager compatibility (npm, Cargo, Poetry), customizable tag filtering, and outputs for version status and build metadata.

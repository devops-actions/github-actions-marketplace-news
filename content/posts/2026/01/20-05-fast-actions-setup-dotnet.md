The `setup-dotnet` GitHub Action streamlines the process of setting up the .NET SDK, Runtime, and ASP.NET Core in CI/CD workflows. It automates tasks such as version resolution (using wildcards, keywords, or `global.json`), parallel downloads, and caching for faster subsequent runs. This action is designed to optimize efficiency and flexibility in managing .NET installations, making it ideal for multi-target testing and dynamic version management.

The `setup-dotnet` GitHub Action provides a fast and efficient way to install .NET SDKs, Runtimes, and ASP.NET Core Runtimes in GitHub Actions workflows. It automates tasks such as parallel downloads, intelligent version resolution (supporting wildcards, keywords, and `global.json`), and caching to optimize performance and reduce redundant installations.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action leverages the Grype vulnerability scanner to detect security vulnerabilities in container images, file directories, or software bill of materials (SBOMs). It automates the process of scanning software components during CI/CD workflows, enabling developers to identify vulnerabilities before deployment or merging code. Key capabilities include local scanning without external dependencies, configurable failure thresholds based on vulnerability severity, and support for various package types and Linux distributions.

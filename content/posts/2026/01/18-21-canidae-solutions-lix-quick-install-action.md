## Action Summary

The `lix-quick-install-action` is a GitHub Action designed to quickly set up [Lix](https://lix.systems/) in single-user mode on Linux and macOS runners, completing the installation in approximately 5 seconds. It provides deterministic installs to ensure consistent environments and allows users to configure the Lix setup to suit their specific needs. This action simplifies and accelerates CI workflows where Lix is required, although dependency management must be handled separately.

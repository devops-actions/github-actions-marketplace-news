## Action Summary

The "Determine Version GitHub Action" automates the process of comparing the current project version (e.g., from `package.json`) with the latest Git tag matching a specified pattern. It identifies whether the version has advanced and outputs the new version or `no changes`. This action streamlines version tracking and helps automate release workflows by ensuring consistency between project versions and Git tags.

## Release notes

This is an update that has been automatically built. For the love of all that is holy, unholy, or morally grey, someone please take the keyboard away from me. I'm going to run out of repo space soon.

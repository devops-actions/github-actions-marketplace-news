## Action Summary

The `action-publint` GitHub Action analyzes a `package.json` file for packaging errors using Publint, helping developers identify and resolve issues that could affect package distribution and compatibility. It automates the linting process to ensure package metadata meets best practices, providing configurable levels of output for suggestions, warnings, and errors. This action streamlines the process of validating npm package configurations, reducing the risk of publishing broken or improperly structured packages.

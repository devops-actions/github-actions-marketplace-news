## Action Summary

The Component Detection Dependency Submission GitHub Action automates the extraction and submission of project dependencies by leveraging the Microsoft Component Detection library. It uses static and dynamic scanning to generate a comprehensive dependency tree and uploads it to GitHub's dependency graph via the dependency submission API. This enhances dependency tracking, improves the accuracy of Dependabot alerts, and supports additional ecosystems, streamlining dependency management for development teams.

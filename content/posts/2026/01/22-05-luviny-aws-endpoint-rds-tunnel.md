## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, AWS Endpoint RDS Tunnel, securely establishes an SSH tunnel between a GitHub Actions Runner and an RDS instance in a private subnet using AWS EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint. It eliminates the need for managing a Bastion Host, streamlining database access for tasks like migrations, schema changes, and data seeding. Key features include secure tunneling to RDS without public IPs, simplified configuration using database connection details, and integration with AWS-managed services.

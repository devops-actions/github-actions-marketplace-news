## Action Summary

The **MCP Server Diff** GitHub Action automates the process of comparing the public interfaces of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers between different versions. It identifies changes in tools, resources, prompts, and capabilities by building and querying server versions, generating a detailed diff report, and surfacing the results directly in GitHub's job summary. This action streamlines interface change tracking, ensuring visibility into how an MCP server's advertised capabilities evolve over time.

## Action Summary

The "GitHub Actions Dependency Submission" action automates the process of scanning a repository's workflow files to identify and submit GitHub Actions dependencies to GitHub's Dependency Graph. It supports recursive scanning of composite actions, detection of callable workflows, and identification of forked and original repositories, enabling organizations to track and manage dependencies effectively for security advisory purposes. Additionally, it offers features such as custom directory scanning and pattern matching for environments without standard fork relationships.

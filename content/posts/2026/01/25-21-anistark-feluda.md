## Action Summary

Feluda is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to analyze project dependencies, identify their licenses, and flag any restrictive or incompatible licenses that may impact personal or commercial use. It automates license compliance by classifying licenses, checking compatibility with the project’s license, and generating compliance files such as NOTICE, THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES, and SPDX-formatted SBOMs. Feluda supports multiple programming languages and integrates into CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

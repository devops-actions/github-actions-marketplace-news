## Action Summary

The **Match Pool Action** is a GitHub Action that automates the assignment of resource pools based on branch and domain patterns by querying predefined rules from an SFP Server. It simplifies dynamic resource allocation for review environments, ensuring the correct pool is selected or falling back to a default if no match is found. This action provides outputs such as the matched pool tag and type, streamlining workflows that depend on environment-specific configurations.

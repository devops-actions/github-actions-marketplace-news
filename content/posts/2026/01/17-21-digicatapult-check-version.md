## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the process of validating and comparing version numbers across package managers (npm, Cargo, and Poetry). It ensures that the version specified in configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) matches across files and is higher than the latest published tag according to semantic versioning rules. The action helps developers maintain consistent versioning and avoid publishing outdated or duplicate versions.

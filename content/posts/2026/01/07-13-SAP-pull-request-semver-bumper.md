## Action Summary

The **Pull Request Semver Bumper** GitHub Action automates semantic version bumping within Pull Requests, ensuring that the version is updated before merging, which keeps the `main` branch clean and deployment-ready. It supports multiple project types (Maven, NPM, Python, and generic version files) and adheres to the Conventional Commits standard, streamlining version management and eliminating the need for separate release commits. This action solves issues like cluttered commit histories, extra CI runs, and race conditions by integrating versioning directly into the PR workflow.

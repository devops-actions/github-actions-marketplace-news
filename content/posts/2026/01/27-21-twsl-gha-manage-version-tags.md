## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the management of semantic version tags by creating or updating shorter version tags (e.g., `v1` or `v1.2`) based on a full semantic version tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`). It streamlines versioning workflows by ensuring that shorthand tags are consistently maintained and updated, making it easier to reference major or minor releases.

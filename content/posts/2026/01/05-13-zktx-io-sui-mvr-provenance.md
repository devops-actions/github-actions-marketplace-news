## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the process of building and deploying Move packages using the Sui CLI, while generating verifiable provenance metadata and registering it in the Move Registry (MVR). It simplifies the creation of trustable and auditable smart contracts by producing SLSA-compliant provenance bundles and metadata for on-chain verification. Key capabilities include compiling bytecode, provenance generation, and metadata registration to ensure transparency and trust in smart contract deployments.

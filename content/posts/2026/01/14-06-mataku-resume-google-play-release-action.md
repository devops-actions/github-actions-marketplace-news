## Action Summary

The "Resume Google Play Release Action" is a GitHub Action designed to automate the resumption of halted releases in the Google Play Console for specific tracks and versions. It simplifies release management by programmatically setting the release status to either `inProgress` for staged rollouts or `completed` for full releases, based on the presence of a `userFraction`. This action supports both Service Account and External Account authentication and provides detailed logging for troubleshooting.

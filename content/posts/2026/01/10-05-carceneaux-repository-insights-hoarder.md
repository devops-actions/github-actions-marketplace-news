## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, "Repository Insights Hoarder," automates the collection and long-term archiving of repository insights, such as stargazers, commits, contributors, traffic views, and clones, which are otherwise only available for 14 days via GitHub. It retrieves this data using the GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs, formats it into JSON or CSV files, and commits the results to a specified branch in a repository for future analysis. This action solves the problem of preserving historical repository metrics for organizations or developers who require continuous tracking and analysis of their project activity over time.

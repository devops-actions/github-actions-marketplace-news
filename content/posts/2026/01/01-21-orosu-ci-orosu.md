## Action Summary

Órosu is a secure CI/CD delivery tool that streamlines deployment by replacing traditional SSH/SCP-based workflows in GitHub Actions and other CI pipelines. It enables CI systems to securely trigger predefined deployment jobs on target machines through WebSocket connections, eliminating the need for SSH keys, hardcoded scripts, and fragile configurations. This tool enhances security, reduces credential sprawl, and simplifies maintenance by offloading deployment execution to a centralized, controlled orosu-server.

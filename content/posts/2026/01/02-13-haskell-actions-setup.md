## Action Summary

The `haskell-actions/setup` GitHub Action automates the setup of a Haskell development environment in CI workflows. It installs and configures specific versions of key Haskell tools like GHC, Cabal, and Stack, ensuring they are added to the system path and providing version-specific outputs. This action simplifies Haskell project builds by streamlining dependency management and tool version configuration, enabling consistent and reproducible development environments.

## Release notes

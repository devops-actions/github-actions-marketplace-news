## Action Summary

Quarkus Roq is a static site generator designed to simplify the creation of websites and blogs by leveraging Java and Quarkus, while abstracting technical complexities for users. It automates tasks such as using structured data (JSON/YAML) in templates, managing content with FrontMatter headers, and generating static HTML and assets from Quarkus applications. This tool streamlines the process of building and deploying static web projects with enhanced type safety and flexibility for content management.

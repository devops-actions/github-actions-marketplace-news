## Action Summary

The **Semgrep SAST Scan Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate static application security testing (SAST) by using Semgrep to scan only changed files in a repository for vulnerabilities. It provides detailed security issue reporting with file annotations, GitHub step summaries, and severity-based categorization, helping developers quickly identify and address common security issues like SQL injection, XSS, and hardcoded secrets. This action streamlines security scanning workflows with fast, incremental scans and extensive language support, ensuring efficient and thorough vulnerability detection.

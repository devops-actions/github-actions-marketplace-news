## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, "Cached LFS Checkout," automates the caching of Git Large File Storage (LFS) downloads to minimize bandwidth usage and prevent exceeding GitHub's LFS download limits during workflows. It addresses the inefficiency of repeatedly downloading large files in workflows by storing them in a cache, thereby reducing repository size bloat and associated costs. This action is particularly beneficial for projects with frequent updates to large binary files.

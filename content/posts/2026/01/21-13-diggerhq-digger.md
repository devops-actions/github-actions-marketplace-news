## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, formerly known as Digger and now rebranded as OpenTaco, provides a secure, cost-effective solution for automating Terraform workflows directly within your existing CI/CD pipeline. It eliminates the need for separate CI systems or third-party servers, enabling seamless Terraform plan, apply, and drift detection operations while maintaining security by keeping sensitive data within your CI environment. Key capabilities include PR-level locking, Open Policy Agent (OPA)-based RBAC, support for multiple Terraform versions, Terragrunt, and integration with cloud-native storage for state management.

## Action Summary

The "TODO Registrar Action" is a GitHub Action that scans your codebase for TODO/FIXME comments and automates the creation of corresponding issues in supported issue trackers, such as GitHub, GitLab, or JIRA. It prevents duplicate issue creation by injecting issue IDs back into the comments and commits the changes to your repository. This action streamlines issue tracking by eliminating the need for external databases and ensuring consistency between TODO comments and issue trackers.

## Action Summary

Plarix Scan is a GitHub Action that tracks and records the actual API token usage and costs of LLM services like OpenAI and Anthropic during CI/CD workflows, local development, or production. By acting as a proxy, it automates cost monitoring, enforces cost thresholds (e.g., blocking pull requests if limits are exceeded), and provides accurate, provider-reported cost data. This tool simplifies the management of LLM-related expenses by generating detailed usage reports and summaries.

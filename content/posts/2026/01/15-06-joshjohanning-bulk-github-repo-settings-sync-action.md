## Action Summary

The "Bulk GitHub Repository Settings Sync Action" automates the process of updating and synchronizing repository settings across multiple GitHub repositories. It enables users to manage configurations such as PR merge strategies, branch deletion, CodeQL scanning, repository topics, and various file templates (e.g., `.gitignore`, `dependabot.yml`, workflow files) efficiently through YAML files or direct inputs. This action minimizes manual effort and ensures consistency across repositories, while offering features like dry-run mode, intelligent change detection, and per-repository overrides for flexibility.

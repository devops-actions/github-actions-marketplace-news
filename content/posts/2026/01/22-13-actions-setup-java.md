## Action Summary

The `setup-java` GitHub Action automates the process of setting up specific Java versions and distributions on GitHub Actions runners, enabling seamless integration with Java and Scala projects. It simplifies tasks like managing Java installations, configuring build tools (Maven, Gradle, sbt), caching dependencies, handling GPG keys, and supporting Maven toolchains. This action streamlines Java project workflows by reducing manual setup overhead and enhancing build performance through dependency caching.

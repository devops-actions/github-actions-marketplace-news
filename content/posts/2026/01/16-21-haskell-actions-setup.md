## Action Summary

This GitHub Action (`haskell-actions/setup`) automates the setup of a Haskell development environment within GitHub workflows. It installs specified versions of GHC, Cabal, and optionally Stack, adds them to the system `PATH`, and outputs relevant configuration details. By simplifying environment configuration, it streamlines CI/CD processes for Haskell projects, reducing manual setup effort and ensuring consistency.

## Action Summary

The `gaze-stars` GitHub Action automates the process of retrieving a user's starred repositories from the GitHub API and generating a README file organized by the user's stargazed list. It solves the problem of manually tracking and curating starred repositories by automatically sorting them (e.g., by stars or update date) and creating a customizable, well-structured README with a Table of Contents for easy navigation. This action is particularly useful for maintaining an up-to-date and organized showcase of favorite repositories.

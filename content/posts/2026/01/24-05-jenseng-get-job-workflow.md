## Action Summary

The `get-job-workflow` GitHub Action retrieves detailed information about the workflow file that defines the currently running job, including its SHA, ref, file path, and repository. It addresses limitations in GitHub's native context by providing insights specific to the reusable workflow that triggered the job, making it easier to handle tasks such as running actions or accessing files from the same workflow reference. This action is particularly useful for automating workflows that need to dynamically reference their own context or related resources.

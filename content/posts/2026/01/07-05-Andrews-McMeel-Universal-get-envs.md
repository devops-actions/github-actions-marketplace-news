## Action Summary

The "Get Environment Variables Action" is a GitHub Action designed to securely retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vaults and make them accessible in your workflows by generating a `.env` file and updating the `$GITHUB_ENV` environment variable. It automates the process of managing sensitive environment variables, ensuring secure handling and masking of secret values in outputs. This action streamlines integration with Azure Key Vaults by supporting both automatic detection of vaults based on environment tags and explicit specification of vault names.

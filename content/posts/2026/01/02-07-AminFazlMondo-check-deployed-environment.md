The **Check Deployed Environment GitHub Action** verifies whether a specific commit is currently deployed to a specified environment in GitHub. It automates the process of checking deployment status, enabling workflows to conditionally proceed based on deployment state. This action is particularly useful for preventing redundant deployments or triggering actions only when a deployment is active in a given environment.

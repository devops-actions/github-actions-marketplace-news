## Action Summary

The `git-restore-mtime` GitHub Action automates the process of restoring file modification timestamps in a Git repository to match their last commit times. This ensures that file timestamps accurately reflect their most recent changes, which is particularly useful for workflows or tools (e.g., S3 synchronization) that rely on correct timestamps for efficient operations. By integrating this action into workflows, developers can avoid issues related to incorrect file modification times.

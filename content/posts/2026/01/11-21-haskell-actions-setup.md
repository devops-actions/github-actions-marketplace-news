## Action Summary

The `haskell-actions/setup` GitHub Action automates the process of setting up a Haskell development environment in CI workflows. It installs requested versions of GHC, Cabal, and Stack, adds them to the system `PATH`, and provides relevant output variables for further use. This action simplifies Haskell environment configuration, ensuring compatibility with specified versions and reducing manual setup effort in continuous integration pipelines.

## Action Summary

The "Email HTML Validator" GitHub Action automates the validation of email newsletter templates by analyzing HTML, files, stdin, or URLs for compatibility with email clients using the "Can I Email" dataset. It identifies accepted, partial, rejected, or unknown features and optionally performs accessibility audits using Playwright and axe-core. Key capabilities include generating reports in multiple formats (JSON, XML, HTML, Markdown) and supporting various runtime interfaces such as CLI, Java DSL, Docker, and GitHub Action for seamless integration into workflows.

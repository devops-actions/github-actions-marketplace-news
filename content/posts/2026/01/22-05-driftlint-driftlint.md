## Action Summary

DriftLinter is a GitHub Action designed to detect and address API drift by comparing the routes in your Flask application with your OpenAPI 3.0 specification. It automates the process of identifying missing, undocumented, or mismatched endpoints and can generate OpenAPI YAML suggestions for undocumented routes using AI. By integrating into CI workflows via Docker, it ensures your API documentation remains accurate and synchronized with your codebase without requiring additional dependency setup.

Stop worrying about outdated documentation. DriftLinter now uses AI to not only find where your API is drifting but to show you exactly how to fix it.

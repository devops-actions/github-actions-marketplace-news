## Action Summary

Apple Policy Lint is a GitHub Action designed to enforce Apple policy compliance in Swift codebases by scanning code using an AST-based approach (tree-sitter). It automates the detection of policy-sensitive APIs, generates detailed reports with remediation guidance, and provides optional merge gating to prevent non-compliant code from being merged. Key capabilities include baseline support to flag only new issues, PR comments for reviewable feedback, and integration with GitHub annotations for streamlined workflow enforcement.

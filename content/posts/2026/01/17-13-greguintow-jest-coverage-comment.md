## Action Summary

The "Jest Coverage Comment" GitHub Action automatically posts a HTML test coverage report to a pull request or commit based on a Jest coverage summary generated in a preceding step. While it does not execute tests itself, it streamlines the process of sharing coverage results, enabling developers to easily track test coverage metrics directly within GitHub workflows. This action enhances collaboration and visibility for code quality during the development lifecycle.

## Release notes

- Fix coverage checking if was lower than required coverage to be successful instead of greater or equal

## Action Summary

The `split-by-codeowners` GitHub Action and CLI tool automates the process of categorizing code changes into buckets based on ownership defined in a `CODEOWNERS` file. It simplifies workflows where changes affect multiple teams by creating smaller, team-specific pull requests, enabling clearer review ownership, independent merges, and rollbacks. Key capabilities include grouping files by owner, generating patches, and optionally creating or updating pull requests per bucket, streamlining collaboration and codemod management.

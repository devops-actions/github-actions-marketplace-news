Version updated for **https://github.com/sbomify/github-action** to version **v0.12**.
- This action is used across all versions by **24** repositories.

## Action Summary

The `sbomify GitHub Action` automates the generation, augmentation, and management of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) directly within CI/CD pipelines. It supports creating SBOMs in CycloneDX or SPDX formats from source code dependencies, Docker images, and other artifacts, while enriching them with metadata for enhanced traceability, compliance, and security. This action streamlines SBOM management, enabling cryptographic signing, attestation, and integration with tools like `sbomify` for collaboration and vulnerability management.

## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a filesystem solution that transforms S3-compatible storage into a fully-functional filesystem, offering file-level access via NFS and 9P, and block-level access through NBD. It automates storage management with high-performance caching, encryption, and compression, enabling tasks like running ZFS, databases, or compiling software directly on S3. By bridging the gap between object storage and traditional file or block storage, ZeroFS simplifies workflows, enhances data integrity, and supports diverse applications with microsecond latencies.

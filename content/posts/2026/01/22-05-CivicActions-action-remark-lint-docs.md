## Action Summary

The `civicactions/action-remark-lint-docs` GitHub Action automates the process of running `remark-lint`, a Markdown linter, on pull requests to identify and annotate issues or suggestions in documentation. It integrates with `reviewdog` to provide a streamlined code review experience, offering opinionated configurations optimized for Prettier-formatted CommonMark Markdown and language feedback through `retext`. This action helps maintain consistent and high-quality documentation by flagging problems and providing actionable feedback.

## Action Summary

The **MCP Server Diff** GitHub Action automates the process of comparing the public interfaces of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers between different versions. It identifies changes in tools, resources, prompts, and server capabilities by generating a detailed diff report and surfacing the results in GitHub's Job Summary. This helps ensure visibility into how server updates affect the interface advertised to AI assistants, aiding in version control and API management.

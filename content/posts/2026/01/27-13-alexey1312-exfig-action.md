## Action Summary

The ExFig Action is a GitHub Action designed to automate the export of design assets such as colors, icons, images, and typography from Figma to a codebase using the ExFig CLI. It streamlines the integration of design elements into development workflows by providing caching for incremental exports, minimizing redundant processing, and supporting advanced filtering and notification capabilities.

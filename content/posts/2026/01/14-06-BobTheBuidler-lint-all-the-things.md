## Action Summary

The **"Lint All The Things" GitHub Action** automates code formatting and linting for Python projects by running tools like `pyupgrade`, `isort`, `black`, and `autoflake` sequentially. It simplifies workflows by detecting and applying changes made by these tools, committing them in a single step with detailed commit messages, and pushing updates or creating pull requests as needed. This action is particularly useful for maintaining consistent code style and reducing manual effort in pull request workflows.

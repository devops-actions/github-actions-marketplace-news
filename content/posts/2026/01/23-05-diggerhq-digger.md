## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, formerly known as Digger and now rebranded as OpenTaco, provides CI/CD automation for Terraform and OpenTofu workflows by running Terraform directly within your existing CI system. It eliminates the need for separate CI tools like Atlantis or Terraform Cloud, enhancing security by keeping secrets within your environment, reducing costs by reusing existing CI infrastructure, and offering features such as pull request automation, RBAC via Open Policy Agent (OPA), drift detection, and PR-level locking. The action simplifies infrastructure-as-code workflows while enabling scalability, flexibility, and self-hosting options.

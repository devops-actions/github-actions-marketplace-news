## Action Summary

The **mypycify** GitHub Action accelerates Python wheel builds in CI pipelines by leveraging caching strategies for build artifacts, compiler cache, and dependencies. It automates tasks such as setting up Python, caching/retrieving build data, compiling wheels, and managing build outputs as artifacts, significantly reducing build times for repeated runs. Additionally, it provides optional features like source file normalization and automated commit/PR creation for efficient CI workflows.

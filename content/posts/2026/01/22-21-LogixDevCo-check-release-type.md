## Action Summary

The "Check Release Type Action" is a GitHub Action designed to validate pull request descriptions by ensuring that exactly one semantic versioning release type (Major, Minor, or Patch) is selected. It automates the enforcement of proper release type selection, prevents errors caused by ambiguous or missing versioning information, and provides clear feedback in case of invalid configurations. Additionally, it supports auto-approval for Dependabot PRs and integrates seamlessly with workflows requiring semantic versioning.

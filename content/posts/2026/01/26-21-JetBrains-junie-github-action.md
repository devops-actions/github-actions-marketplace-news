## Action Summary

The Junie GitHub Action integrates JetBrains' AI coding agent, Junie, into GitHub workflows to automate tasks such as code changes, issue resolution, pull request (PR) management, and merge conflict resolution. It enables intelligent code analysis, automated fixes, inline code reviews, and CI failure analysis while providing interactive responses to developer comments and requests.

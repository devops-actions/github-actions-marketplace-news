## Action Summary

MemBrowse is a tool designed to analyze the memory footprint of embedded firmware by extracting detailed memory information from ELF files and linker scripts. It provides symbol-level analysis with source file mapping, supports multiple architectures, and integrates into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate memory usage tracking, historical comparisons, and monitoring. The tool helps developers optimize firmware memory usage and maintain efficient resource allocation across builds.

## Release notes

## What's Changed
* shift right and left handing in linker scripts
* onboard optimization
* added claude skill to integrate membrowse to a repo
* fix multi parent in onboard
* fix cpp symbol to source mapping

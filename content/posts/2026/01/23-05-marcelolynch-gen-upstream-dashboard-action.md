## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the process of identifying and categorizing files in downstream projects that are candidates for upstreaming into the `Mathlib` repository. It inspects a downstream repository, evaluating files based on readiness for upstreaming and generating Markdown dashboards that highlight files ready to contribute, as well as those requiring minimal effort to prepare. This action streamlines collaboration by providing clear visibility into upstreaming progress and potential contributions.

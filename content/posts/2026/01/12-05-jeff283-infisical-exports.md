## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, **Infisical Exports**, automates the process of exporting secrets from an Infisical instance into organized `.env` files based on folder paths, making them available for use in GitHub Actions workflows. It addresses the challenge of managing secrets in CI environments, particularly for applications like those on Cloudflare that require secrets in `.env` files rather than injected environment variables. The action also includes automatic cleanup of generated `.env` files after workflow completion.

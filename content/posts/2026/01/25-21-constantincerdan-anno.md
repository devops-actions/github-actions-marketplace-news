## Action Summary

Anno is a GitHub Action that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate the creation of concise summaries for release notes and pull requests. In "release-summary" mode, it generates Slack messages summarizing code changes between workflow runs, with optional integration with Jira for tracking related issues. In "pr-summary" mode, it provides brief summaries for pull request descriptions, streamlining communication and improving collaboration.

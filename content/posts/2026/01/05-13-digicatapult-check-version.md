## Action Summary

This GitHub Action verifies that the version in your project files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `pyproject.toml`) is consistent across files and higher than the latest published version tag, following semantic versioning (semver) rules. It automates version validation for projects using npm, Cargo, or Poetry, ensuring alignment and preventing accidental version mismatches or regressions. Key capabilities include checking version consistency, comparing against existing tags, and indicating if the version is new or a prerelease.

## Action Summary

The **AWS ECR Docker Builder Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate the process of building and pushing Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). It streamlines CI/CD workflows by managing AWS authentication (via OIDC), Docker image building, tagging, and deployment to ECR, eliminating the need for manual credential handling. Key features include seamless AWS ECR integration, branch-specific image tagging, and flexible configuration options for Dockerfile paths, image tags, and build contexts.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the creation of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using Syft, enabling users to scan container images, directories, or files to generate SBOMs in SPDX format. It simplifies the process of documenting software components and dependencies, and can upload SBOMs as workflow artifacts or GitHub release assets, addressing compliance, security, and transparency needs in software development. Key features include support for direct registry authentication, artifact naming customization, and compatibility with matrix builds.

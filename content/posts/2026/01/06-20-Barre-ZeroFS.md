## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a high-performance filesystem that enables S3-compatible storage to function as a primary storage solution, offering both file-level access via NFS and 9P, and block-level access via NBD. It automates access to S3 storage as a traditional filesystem or block device while ensuring encryption and multi-layered caching for optimized performance. ZeroFS solves the challenge of integrating cloud object storage into workflows requiring POSIX compliance, real-time file operations, or database-backed systems.

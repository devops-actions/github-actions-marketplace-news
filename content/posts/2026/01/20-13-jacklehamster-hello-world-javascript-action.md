## Action Summary

The Dobuki Directory Generator GitHub Action automates the process of listing all files in a repository and generating a `dir.json` file at the root. This is particularly useful for static websites hosted via GitHub Pages, as it provides a way to reference and manage repository files dynamically without needing server-side file listing capabilities.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the deployment of containerized applications to Amazon ECS using Express Mode, which simplifies infrastructure management by automatically provisioning resources like load balancers, target groups, and security groups. It streamlines ECS service creation and updates, handles scaling, and ensures deployments reach a stable state. By automating these processes, it reduces the complexity of deploying applications to ECS and provides key outputs like service status and endpoint URLs.

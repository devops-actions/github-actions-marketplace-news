## Action Summary

The `install-llvm-action` GitHub Action automates the process of downloading and installing specific versions of LLVM and Clang binaries in CI/CD workflows. It simplifies environment setup by adding the installed binaries to relevant system variables (e.g., `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) and supports specifying versions, architectures, and installation directories. This action is particularly useful for developers needing consistent and automated access to LLVM and Clang tools across various platforms and architectures.

## Action Summary

The `eslint-annotations` GitHub Action automates the process of adding detailed annotations to pull requests and commits based on ESLint and TypeScript errors or warnings. It addresses challenges where frameworks like Next.js output linting results in unsupported formats, ensuring that code issues are clearly visible in GitHub's interface. This action enhances code review workflows by supporting flexible error reporting, annotations for modified files, and integration with GitHub's status checks.

## Action Summary

The Contrast Verify GitHub Action automates the process of verifying applications onboarded to Contrast Security by assessing them against defined Job Outcome Policies or thresholds of open vulnerabilities. It helps identify and enforce security standards by filtering vulnerabilities based on severity, build numbers, or timestamps, ensuring that only compliant builds are deployed. This action streamlines application security checks, reducing manual effort while maintaining consistent vulnerability assessment.

## Action Summary

The "wasm-action" GitHub Action facilitates interaction with WebAssembly registries by automating the processes of pushing and pulling WebAssembly (WASM) artifacts. It supports the "warg" registry type (e.g., wa.dev) and provides a versatile interface that can be used as a GitHub Action, CLI tool, or Python library.

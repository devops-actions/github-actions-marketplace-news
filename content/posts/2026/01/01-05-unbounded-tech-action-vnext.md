## Action Summary

The **action-vnext** GitHub Action provides an automated way to calculate the next semantic version of your project by analyzing Git commit history based on Conventional Commit standards. It eliminates the need for Node.js or a `package.json`, offering a lightweight and language-agnostic solution for versioning across any CI/CD pipeline. Key features include precise version bump calculations (major, minor, patch) and optional changelog generation, all packaged in a simple Docker-based tool.

## Action Summary

The `semantic-issue-action` is a GitHub Action that ensures issue titles in a repository adhere to the Conventional Commits specification. It automates the validation process by checking issue titles when specific events (e.g., issue creation or editing) occur and posts comments if titles fail to meet the standard. This action helps maintain consistency and semantic structure in issue tracking, enabling improved organization and clarity in project management.

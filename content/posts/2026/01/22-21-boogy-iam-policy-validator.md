## Action Summary

The IAM Policy Validator GitHub Action helps automate the identification and resolution of security risks and misconfigurations in AWS IAM policies. It detects issues such as privilege escalation chains, overly permissive access, trust policy vulnerabilities, and syntax errors before deployment. This tool streamlines policy validation, ensuring adherence to security best practices and reducing the risk of breaches caused by misconfigured permissions or dangerous patterns.

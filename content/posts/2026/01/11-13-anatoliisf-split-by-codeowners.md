## Action Summary

The `split-by-codeowners` GitHub Action and CLI tool automates the process of splitting local changes into groups based on the ownership defined in a repository's `CODEOWNERS` file. It simplifies collaboration by creating smaller, more focused pull requests (PRs) for each owner group, enabling clearer review assignment, easier merges, and independent rollbacks. The tool supports both CI-based workflows and local development, offering capabilities such as generating patches, grouping changes by owners, and optionally creating or updating PRs for each group.

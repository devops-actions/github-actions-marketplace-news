## Action Summary

The `setup-clojure` GitHub Action automates the setup of a Clojure development environment in GitHub Actions workflows by installing various Clojure tools, including Clojure CLI, Leiningen, Boot, Babashka, and others, on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows runners. It simplifies the process of configuring Clojure tools and ensures compatibility across platforms, enabling developers to efficiently run Clojure-based tasks such as builds, tests, and linting in CI/CD pipelines. This action supports caching of dependencies and provides flexibility to install specific versions or the latest versions of the supported tools.

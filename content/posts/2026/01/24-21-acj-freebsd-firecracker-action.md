## Action Summary

This GitHub Action allows users to launch a FreeBSD virtual machine (VM) within a Firecracker microVM environment, enabling lightweight, fast (10-15 seconds boot time) VM instances for workflows on GitHub Actions. It automates tasks such as running commands inside or outside the VM, transferring files to and from the VM, and configuring VM resources like disk size. This action is particularly useful for testing, building, and running FreeBSD-specific workloads in isolated environments.

## Release notes

Changes:
- Upgrade to Firecracker 1.14.1

## Action Summary

The Link Validator GitHub Action automates the detection of broken links in documentation by validating GitHub URLs, HTTP(S) links, and local Markdown file paths. It helps prevent issues caused by link rot, file restructuring, and access changes by catching broken links during CI workflows or pull request reviews. This tool is optimized for GitHub-specific URL patterns, supports GitHub Enterprise, and integrates seamlessly into CI pipelines to ensure the accuracy and reliability of project documentation.

## Action Summary

SecondBrain is a command-line tool designed to access and filter data from various external sources (e.g., Salesforce, Slack, ZenDesk, YouTube, etc.) and analyze it using a Large Language Model (LLM) through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It automates tasks such as extracting and querying relevant information, generating summaries, and creating insights or reports from disparate, unstructured data sources. Key capabilities include directory scanning for relevant content, analyzing GitHub repository changes, and summarizing YouTube transcripts, enabling efficient data analysis and knowledge extraction across multiple platforms.

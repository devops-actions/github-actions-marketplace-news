Version updated for **https://github.com/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin** to version **v1.5**.
- This action is used across all versions by **351** repositories.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action sets up the Kotlin CLI compiler (`kotlinc` and `kotlin`) in workflows, enabling users to compile Kotlin code, run scripts, and optionally build native binaries. It automates the installation of specific Kotlin versions and ensures compatibility in environments where Kotlin is not pre-installed, such as custom containers or runners. This is particularly useful for workflows requiring direct use of Kotlin CLI tools or precise version control.

## Action Summary

The Junie GitHub Action integrates JetBrains' AI-powered coding assistant, Junie, into GitHub workflows to automate tasks such as code changes, issue resolution, pull request (PR) management, and conflict resolution. It streamlines development by enabling features like automated issue fixes, inline code reviews, CI failure analysis, and merge conflict handling, all triggered through mentions, labels, or custom prompts. This action enhances collaboration and efficiency by providing intelligent feedback, generating detailed reports, and ensuring security through prompt sanitization and sensitive data redaction.

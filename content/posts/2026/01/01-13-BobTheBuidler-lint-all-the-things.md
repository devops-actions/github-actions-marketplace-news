## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, **Lint All The Things**, automates the process of linting and formatting Python codebases by sequentially running `pyupgrade`, `black`, and `autoflake`. It simplifies code maintenance by automatically detecting, committing, and pushing changes made by these tools, streamlining tasks often performed during pull request workflows. Its key capabilities include ensuring consistent code quality, reducing manual effort, and maintaining clarity with separate commits for each tool's modifications.

## Action Summary

The `actions/attest` GitHub Action automates the generation and signing of artifact attestations, linking workflow artifacts to their associated assertions (predicates) using the in-toto format. It ensures the provenance and integrity of build artifacts by creating verifiable, short-lived signatures via Sigstore, and uploads these signed attestations to the GitHub attestations API for tracking and verification. This action is ideal for projects that require artifact traceability and secure supply chain practices.

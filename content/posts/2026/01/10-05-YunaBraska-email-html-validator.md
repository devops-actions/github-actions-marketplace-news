## Action Summary

The "Email HTML Validator" GitHub Action automates the validation of newsletter HTML templates by assessing their compatibility across the "Can I Email" dataset and performing optional accessibility audits using Playwright and axe-core. It simplifies the process of identifying supported, partially supported, and unsupported HTML features, while generating detailed reports in various formats (JSON, XML, HTML, Markdown). This tool is ideal for streamlining email template reviews in CI/CD workflows, ensuring compatibility and accessibility standards are met efficiently.

## Action Summary

The GitHub Action for SBOM Generation automates the creation of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) using Syft, enabling users to scan container images, directories, or specific files within their repositories. It generates SBOMs in SPDX format, uploads them as artifacts, and integrates with GitHub releases to attach SBOMs as release assets. This action simplifies dependency tracking, enhances software supply chain transparency, and supports compliance with software composition analysis requirements.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action enables users to run CI workflows on OpenIndiana, an operating system not natively supported by GitHub Actions (which only supports Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS). It automates the setup and execution of CI processes within an OpenIndiana virtual machine, providing functionality such as environment variable synchronization, code sharing between host and VM, and configurable VM parameters like memory, CPU, and network settings. This action is ideal for developers requiring OpenIndiana-specific CI environments while maintaining compatibility with GitHub-hosted workflows.

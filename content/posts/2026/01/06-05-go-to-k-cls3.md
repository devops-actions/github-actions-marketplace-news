## Action Summary

The `cls3` GitHub Action is a command-line tool designed to efficiently manage and automate the emptying and deletion of AWS S3 buckets, including those with versioning enabled. It allows users to search for bucket names, perform bulk operations across multiple buckets (even across regions), and provides advanced options like deleting only old object versions or handling S3-compatible storage with custom endpoint URLs. This tool simplifies S3 bucket management tasks, saving time and reducing manual effort.

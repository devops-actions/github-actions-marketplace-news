## Action Summary

The **Template Parts** library acts as a polyfill for the proposed Template Instance API, enabling developers to dynamically manipulate template content using JavaScript objects. It automates the process of binding data to template placeholders (`{{x}}`, `{{y}}`, etc.) and updating DOM elements in a structured and efficient way. Key capabilities include dynamic parameter updates, support for boolean attributes, and compatibility with a proposed future web standard, making it easy to adopt or transition to native implementations if the proposal is standardized.

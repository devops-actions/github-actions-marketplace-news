## Action Summary

The Docker Build and Push Action is a streamlined wrapper around the official `docker/build-push-action`, designed to simplify Docker image building and pushing workflows. It automates tasks such as generating smart tags, supporting multi-architecture builds, and ensuring consistent metadata, while providing input validation and enhanced security features like SBOM and provenance attestations. This action reduces configuration complexity and minimizes common errors, making it easier to manage multi-registry deployments and traceable image tagging.

## Action Summary

The LOCI GitHub Action provides automated performance analysis of compiled binaries to predict power spikes, performance inefficiencies, and reliability issues in hardware and software. It optimizes code, configurations, and serving processes autonomously, delivering insights directly in workflow summaries and optionally as PR comments when integrated with the LOCI GitHub App. This action helps developers reduce costs and time to resolution by uncovering anomalies, shifting observability left, and identifying emerging trends in dynamic data.

## Action Summary

The `cls3` CLI tool is designed to efficiently manage and automate the clearing and deletion of Amazon S3 buckets, including deleting all objects, versions, and delete markers, or removing the buckets entirely. It simplifies tasks such as searching for bucket names, managing multiple buckets across regions, and handling buckets with versioning enabled. Key features include selective deletion of old object versions, support for S3-compatible storage with custom endpoint URLs, and specialized modes for managing specific bucket types like Directory Buckets, Table Buckets, and Vector Buckets.

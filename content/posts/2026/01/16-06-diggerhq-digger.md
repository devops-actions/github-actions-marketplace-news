## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, formerly known as Digger and now rebranded as OpenTaco, provides a CI/CD solution for running Terraform or OpenTofu directly within your existing CI environment. It automates tasks such as Terraform plan and apply, PR-level locks, and drift detection while improving security by keeping sensitive data within your CI and eliminating the need for third-party infrastructure. Key capabilities include support for Open Policy Agent (OPA), scalable compute, and integration with existing CI systems, making it a cost-effective and secure alternative to tools like Atlantis and Terraform Cloud.

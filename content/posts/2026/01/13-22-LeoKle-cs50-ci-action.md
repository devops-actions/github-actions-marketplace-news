## Action Summary

The CS50 CI GitHub Action automates the validation of problem-set tests by running them against known solutions in a CI workflow. It ensures that test updates do not break valid solutions or fail to detect invalid ones, providing pass/fail feedback via console output and PR comments. This action simplifies test verification for instructors and integrates seamlessly into pull request workflows.

## Action Summary

Codeowners Plus is a GitHub Action designed to enhance and extend the functionality of GitHub's native CODEOWNERS feature. It automates and streamlines code ownership and review processes by introducing advanced capabilities such as smart dismissal of stale reviews, support for multiple ownership rules (AND logic), directory-level ownership configuration, and optional reviewers. This tool simplifies managing required reviews, enforces advanced ownership rules, and provides repository administrators with greater control over code review workflows.

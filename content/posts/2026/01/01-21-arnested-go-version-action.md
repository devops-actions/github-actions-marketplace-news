## Action Summary

The **Go version action** is a GitHub Action that automates the process of managing Go versions in CI workflows by reading the minimal supported version from a project's `go.mod` file and identifying the latest Go release. It generates a build matrix containing all supported Go versions between the minimal and latest releases, ensuring consistent and up-to-date testing across multiple Go versions. This action solves the problem of manually updating workflows for new Go releases, ensuring compatibility and reducing maintenance overhead.

## Action Summary

The **Link Validator** GitHub Action automates the process of identifying and reporting broken links in documentation, including GitHub-specific links (e.g., issues, PRs, workflows), HTTP(S) links, local Markdown paths, and Datadog URLs. By integrating into CI pipelines, it helps ensure documentation accuracy by detecting broken or outdated links during pull requests or repository pushes, preventing issues before they reach production. Its key capabilities include support for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise Server APIs, authentication, rate-limiting, and the ability to validate only updated files in PRs for efficient cleanup.

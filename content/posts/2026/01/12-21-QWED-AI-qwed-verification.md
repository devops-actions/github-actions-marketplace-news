## Action Summary

QWED Protocol is an open-source verification tool designed to ensure accuracy and reliability in outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), regardless of the model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama). It uses eight specialized verification engines to detect and prevent AI hallucinations, ensuring only verifiable outputs are deployed in production environments. By providing a model-agnostic, deterministic verification layer, QWED addresses trust and reliability concerns in AI systems and automates the validation of AI-generated content.

## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a filesystem solution that enables S3-compatible storage to function as a primary storage system by providing file-level access via NFS and 9P, and block-level access via NBD. It simplifies the use of S3 storage for applications requiring traditional filesystem or block device interfaces, offering features like encryption, high-performance caching, and POSIX semantics. ZeroFS is suitable for use cases such as running operating systems, compiling code, and creating ZFS pools directly on S3 storage, addressing the challenge of efficiently using object storage as high-performance, secure, and accessible primary storage.

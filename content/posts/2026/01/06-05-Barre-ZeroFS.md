## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a filesystem that enables users to utilize S3-compatible object storage as primary storage. It provides file-level access via NFS and 9P protocols and block-level access via NBD, supporting use cases like ZFS deployment and database storage. With features such as encryption, compression, high-performance caching, and full S3 compatibility, ZeroFS automates the integration of S3 storage into traditional filesystem workflows, solving the challenges of accessing and managing cloud-based storage with low latency and high efficiency.

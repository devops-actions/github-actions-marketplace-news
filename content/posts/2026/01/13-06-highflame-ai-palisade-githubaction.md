## Action Summary

The Palisade GitHub Action integrates an enterprise-grade machine learning (ML) model security scanner into CI/CD workflows to detect backdoors, supply chain attacks, and malicious payloads before deployment. It automates the validation of model integrity, provenance, and security through static analysis, preventing exploits such as remote code execution, tampering, and injection attacks. Powered by a Rust core for high performance, it efficiently handles large models and enforces a zero-trust approach to ML model security.

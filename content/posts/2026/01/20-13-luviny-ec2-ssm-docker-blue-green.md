## Action Summary

The **SSM Parameter Store Env Loader** GitHub Action automates the process of fetching parameters from AWS SSM Parameter Store and makes them available as environment variables or saves them to a file (e.g., `.env`). It simplifies managing secrets and configuration by supporting recursive parameter retrieval, automatic decryption of secure strings, and masking sensitive data in logs. This action is particularly useful for securely injecting configuration values into CI/CD workflows.

## Action Summary

Early-Catch is a GitHub Action that automates the generation of unit tests for TypeScript and JavaScript code changes in pull requests. It identifies uncovered functions in changed files, generates working tests (e.g., for Jest), and auto-commits them to the source branch, ensuring no broken code is added. This tool streamlines the testing process, improves code coverage, and reduces the manual effort required to write tests, enhancing development efficiency and code quality.

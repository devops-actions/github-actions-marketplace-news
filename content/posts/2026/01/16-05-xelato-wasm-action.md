## Action Summary

The `wasm-action` GitHub Action facilitates interaction with WebAssembly registries by automating the process of pushing and pulling WebAssembly (WASM) artifacts. It supports the `warg` registry type (e.g., wa.dev) and allows users to manage WASM packages efficiently via GitHub Actions, a CLI tool, or a Python library. This action simplifies workflows by streamlining artifact management in multi-platform environments (Linux, macOS, Windows) with support for Python 3.10+.

## Action Summary

The Jest Coverage Comment GitHub Action automatically posts an HTML test coverage report as a comment on a pull request or commit, based on a Jest coverage report generated by a separate test execution step. This helps developers quickly review code coverage metrics directly within their workflow, streamlining code review processes and ensuring test coverage visibility. It supports features like updating or creating new comments and customizing visibility of the report.

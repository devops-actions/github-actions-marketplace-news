## Action Summary

The "Email HTML Validator" GitHub Action automates the validation of newsletter templates by analyzing inline HTML, files, stdin, or URLs for compatibility with the "Can I Email" dataset. It identifies accepted, partial, rejected, or unknown features and optionally performs accessibility audits using Playwright and axe-core. The action streamlines email template validation workflows by generating comprehensive reports in various formats (JSON, XML, HTML, Markdown) and integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines or local testing environments.

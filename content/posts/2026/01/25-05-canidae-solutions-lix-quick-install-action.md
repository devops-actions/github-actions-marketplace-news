## Action Summary

The "lix quick install action" is a GitHub Action designed to quickly set up Lix, a fork of Nix, in single-user mode within GitHub Actions workflows, achieving installation speeds of around 5 seconds. It provides deterministic installations, supports Linux and macOS runners, and allows users to customize the Lix setup as needed. This action simplifies CI/CD workflows by automating the Lix installation process, though it requires users to manage dependencies separately.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action enables users to run CI workflows on the OpenIndiana operating system, addressing the limitation that GitHub Actions natively supports only Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. It automates the setup of an OpenIndiana virtual machine, synchronizes code and environment variables between the host and the VM, and provides options for file sharing, networking, and resource allocation. This action is ideal for developers requiring OpenIndiana-specific CI environments.

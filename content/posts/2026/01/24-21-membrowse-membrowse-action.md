## Action Summary

MemBrowse is a tool designed for analyzing the memory footprint of embedded firmware by extracting detailed memory information from ELF files and linker scripts. It automates tasks like symbol-level analysis, source file mapping, memory region extraction, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines to provide historical tracking, build diffs, and monitoring. The GitHub Action facilitates on-the-fly memory analysis during pull requests, historical data onboarding, and integration with tools like Claude Code for streamlined setup and reporting.

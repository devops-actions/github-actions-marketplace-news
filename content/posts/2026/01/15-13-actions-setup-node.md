## Action Summary

The `setup-node` GitHub Action automates the process of setting up a specific Node.js version in workflows, optionally caching Node.js distributions and npm/yarn/pnpm dependencies to improve efficiency. It also provides error detection using problem matchers and supports authentication for npm and GitHub Package Registry (GPR). This helps streamline CI/CD pipelines for JavaScript and Node.js projects while reducing setup time and ensuring consistency across environments.

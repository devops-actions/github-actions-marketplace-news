## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, **AWS Endpoint RDS Tunnel**, establishes a secure SSH tunnel between a GitHub Actions runner and an RDS instance located in a private subnet using AWS EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint. It eliminates the need for managing a Bastion Host, simplifying database access for tasks such as migrations, schema changes, and data seeding. Key features include secure tunneling to RDS databases without public IPs, easy configuration with minimal inputs, and seamless integration with AWS services.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action tracks the usage of GitHub API requests within a workflow job, categorized by rate-limit buckets such as `core`, `GraphQL`, and `search`. It automates the process of capturing API rate-limit states at the start and end of a job, providing detailed insights into API consumption and remaining limits. This helps developers monitor API usage efficiently, optimize workflows, and avoid exceeding rate limits.

## Release notes

chore: update all dependencies and pin to exact versions
chore: add debug log for final rate limit snapshot

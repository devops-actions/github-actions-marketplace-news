## Action Summary

The "Secret Scanning Review Action" is a GitHub Action designed to enhance visibility and enforce security by identifying secret scanning alerts in pull requests. It automatically annotates files, summarizes detected secrets, and optionally fails status checks, ensuring that any introduced secrets are addressed before merging. This Action helps automate secret detection in areas not covered by push protection and strengthens peer review processes to prevent oversight of critical security risks.

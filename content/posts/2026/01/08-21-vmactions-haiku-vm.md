## Action Summary

This GitHub Action allows users to run continuous integration (CI) workflows on the Haiku operating system, which is not natively supported by GitHub Actions. It automates the setup of a virtual machine running Haiku, synchronizes the host environment (source code, environment variables, etc.) with the VM, and provides options to configure resource allocation, file synchronization, and network settings. This action is ideal for developers needing to test or build applications in a Haiku environment within their CI pipeline.

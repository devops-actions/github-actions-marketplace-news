## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a filesystem solution that enables seamless integration of S3-compatible object storage, providing both file-level access via NFS and 9P and block-level access via NBD. It solves the challenge of using S3 as primary storage by offering POSIX-compliant file operations, encryption, compression, and high-performance caching with microsecond latencies. Key capabilities include the ability to mount S3 storage as a network filesystem, use it as raw block devices for applications like ZFS and databases, and ensure data security through always-on encryption.

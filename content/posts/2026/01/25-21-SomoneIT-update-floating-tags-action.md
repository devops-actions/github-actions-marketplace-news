## Action Summary

The "Update Floating Version Tags" GitHub Action automates the creation and updating of major and minor floating semantic version tags whenever a release is published. It eliminates the need for manual tag management, ensuring floating tags (e.g., `v1` or `v1.2`) always point to the latest release within their respective version range. This helps streamline versioning practices and provides users with predictable stability options.

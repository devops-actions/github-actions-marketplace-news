## Action Summary

The **mypycify** GitHub Action is designed to optimize Python wheel builds in CI workflows by leveraging caching strategies to speed up repeated builds. It automates tasks such as setting up Python, managing compiler and build artifact caches, building wheels, and uploading them for use in subsequent jobs or releases. By significantly reducing build times and providing flexible caching and artifact management, it streamlines CI processes for Python projects, particularly those involving native extensions.

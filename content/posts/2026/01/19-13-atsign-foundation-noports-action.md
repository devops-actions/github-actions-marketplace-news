## Action Summary

The **NoPorts GitHub Action** allows users to automate the installation and configuration of NoPorts, a tool for establishing secure, portless connections, within their GitHub Actions workflows. It simplifies the process of setting up and managing NoPorts binaries and authentication (e.g., atKeys files), enabling developers to create secure tunnels and connections without requiring exposed ports. This action is particularly useful for automating tasks like remote access, secure tunneling, and data exchange during CI/CD workflows.

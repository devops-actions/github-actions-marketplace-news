## Action Summary

Semantic Firewall is an advanced static analysis tool for Go that focuses on understanding code behavior and intent rather than just textual patterns. It detects malware, backdoors, and risky code changes, even in obfuscated or refactored code, by analyzing structural and behavioral differences. This tool automates tasks like behavioral fingerprinting, risk-aware diffs, and dependency scanning, helping security teams prevent hidden threats and ensure code integrity.

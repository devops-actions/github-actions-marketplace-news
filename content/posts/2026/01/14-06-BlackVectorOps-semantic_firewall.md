## Action Summary

Semantic Firewall is a static analysis engine designed for Go code, enabling behavioral analysis by generating deterministic fingerprints of code behavior rather than its textual representation. It automates tasks such as detecting malicious code patterns, identifying obfuscation, and proving code equivalence despite stylistic or syntactic changes. Its key capabilities include semantic diffing, malware detection through topology matching, loop equivalence analysis, and structural fingerprinting, making it ideal for security research and code integrity verification.

## Release notes

Fixes module path to include /v2 suffix. Updates examples to be buildable.

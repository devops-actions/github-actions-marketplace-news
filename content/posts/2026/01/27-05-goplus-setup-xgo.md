## Action Summary

The `setup-xgo` GitHub Action sets up an XGo environment in workflows by installing Go and XGo, optionally caching specific versions, and adding them to the `PATH`. It automates the configuration process for cross-compiling Go applications using XGo, ensuring compatibility through SemVer-based version matching. Additionally, it enhances error handling by registering problem matchers for improved debugging.

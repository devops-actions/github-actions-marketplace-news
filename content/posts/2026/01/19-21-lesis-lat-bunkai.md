## Action Summary

Bunkai is a lightweight Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool designed for Perl projects. It analyzes a project's `cpanfile` to identify dependencies, detect outdated or vulnerable modules, and highlight missing version specifications to improve build stability and security. This tool helps automate dependency management, enhances security by identifying supply chain risks, and supports integration with GitHub workflows for advanced security analysis using SARIF reports.

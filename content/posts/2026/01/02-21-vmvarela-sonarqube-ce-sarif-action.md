## Action Summary

This GitHub Action integrates SonarQube Community Edition with GitHub by converting SonarQube scan results into SARIF format and uploading them to the GitHub Security Tab. It automates PR feedback through inline annotations, check summaries, and issue tracking in GitHub's Security Tab, addressing the lack of native integration in SonarQube CE. Key capabilities include PR decoration, smart issue filtering, and optional quality gate enforcement based on issue severity.

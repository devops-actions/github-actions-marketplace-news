## Action Summary

The `tailor-log` GitHub Action and CLI tool automates the process of fetching and managing logs from the Tailor Platform. It enables users to ingest logs (including function and pipeline resolver logs) and send them to external services like Datadog with customizable options, such as tags and service names, while avoiding duplicate processing. Additionally, it provides real-time log streaming functionality with configurable fetch intervals, simplifying log monitoring and integration workflows.

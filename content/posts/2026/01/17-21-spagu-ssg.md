## Action Summary

The SSG GitHub Action is a simple static site generator written in Go that automates the conversion of content from WordPress exports (Markdown with YAML frontmatter) into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It streamlines tasks such as responsive design, clean URL generation, media file management, and WebP image conversion, with additional features like built-in HTTP server, auto-rebuild on changes, and minification for optimized builds. Designed for ease of use and efficiency, it integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines and supports deployment to platforms like Cloudflare Pages.

## Action Summary

The `detect-rust-minimum-version` GitHub Action automates the process of identifying the minimum required Rust version for a project by analyzing its source code and `Cargo.toml` file. It streamlines compatibility checks by determining the highest minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) across specified project paths, helping developers ensure their project adheres to Rust version requirements. This action is particularly useful for maintaining version consistency and avoiding issues with dependencies or outdated Rust versions.

## Action Summary

Marimushka is a tool designed to export Marimo notebooks into customizable HTML or WebAssembly formats, enabling the creation of interactive web versions that can be shared or deployed to static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages. It automates the conversion process and supports features like customizable templates, integration with GitHub Actions for deployment, and the generation of an index page listing all notebooks and applications. This action streamlines sharing and hosting Marimo-based projects without requiring Python installations on the user's end.

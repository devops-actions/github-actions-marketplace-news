## Action Summary

The DAST Security Scan Action is a GitHub Action that automates Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using PortSwigger's Dastardly scanner to identify vulnerabilities in live web applications. It helps detect OWASP Top 10 security risks and other common web vulnerabilities, generating detailed reports in JUnit format, workflow summaries, and GitHub check runs. This action streamlines security testing by integrating it into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring early detection and mitigation of security issues.

## Action Summary

The **AWS SSM Run Command Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate the execution of remote shell commands on Amazon EC2 instances via AWS Systems Manager (SSM). It eliminates the need for SSH access, works with both public and private EC2 instances, and stores command output in an S3 bucket to bypass GitHub Actions' log size limits. This action simplifies remote management tasks for Linux-based EC2 instances, making it easier to run and log commands securely and efficiently.

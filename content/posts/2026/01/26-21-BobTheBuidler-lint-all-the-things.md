## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, "Lint All The Things," automates the process of linting and formatting codebases by sequentially running tools like pyupgrade, isort, black, autoflake, and Prettier for JSON/YAML files. It solves the problem of ensuring consistent code quality and formatting across repositories by committing code changes automatically (using Poosh) or opening a pull request when modifications are detected. Key capabilities include handling multiple tools, respecting repository-specific configurations, generating detailed commit messages, and supporting PR workflows.

## Action Summary

The `md-press` GitHub Action automates the process of converting Markdown documents into a PDF, HTML page, and a preview image, and then deploys them to GitHub Pages. It simplifies the workflow for publishing single or multi-document projects, with support for customization such as filenames, PDF styling, and multi-file configurations. This action is particularly useful for creating professional, shareable documents directly from Markdown files while eliminating manual conversion and deployment tasks.

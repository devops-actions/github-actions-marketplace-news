## Action Summary

This GitHub Action compares the version specified in package management files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `pyproject.toml`) with the latest published tag in the repository. It ensures the local version is consistent across files and verifies that it is higher than the newest published version based on semantic versioning rules. This action automates version consistency checks and prevents unintentional versioning issues in software projects.

## Action Summary

The **TODO Registrar Action** is a GitHub Action designed to scan codebases for TODO/FIXME comments and automatically create corresponding issues in supported issue trackers (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, JIRA). It prevents duplicate issues by injecting issue IDs back into the TODO comments and committing these changes to the repository, eliminating the need for an external tracking database. This action automates issue creation and management, streamlining development workflows and ensuring better tracking of pending tasks within a codebase.

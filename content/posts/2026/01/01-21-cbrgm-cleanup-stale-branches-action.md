## Action Summary

The **Cleanup Stale Branches Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate the deletion of abandoned or stale branches in a repository based on customizable criteria, such as inactivity, lack of open pull requests, or branch protection status. It helps streamline repository management by removing unnecessary branches, reducing clutter, and maintaining an organized codebase. Key capabilities include configurable branch exclusion lists, prefix-based filtering, and a dry-run mode for safe operation.

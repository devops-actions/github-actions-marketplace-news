## Action Summary

The "Branch Release" GitHub Action automates the process of releasing code by publishing build artifacts (e.g., dist files) to a specific GitHub branch. It uses Conventional Commits to determine version updates, generates GitHub release notes, tags the release with semantic versioning, and pushes the updated build files to the release branch. This action simplifies version management, eliminates the need to store build artifacts in the main branch, and streamlines the release workflow for projects.

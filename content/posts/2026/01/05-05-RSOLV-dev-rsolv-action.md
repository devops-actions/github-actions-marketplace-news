## Action Summary

RSOLV is a GitHub Action designed to identify, validate, and fix security vulnerabilities in codebases using a test-first approach. It automates the detection of vulnerabilities, generates failing tests to prove their existence, and applies AI-generated fixes validated by passing those tests, ensuring effective and reliable resolutions. This action enhances security by preventing regression through the integration of exploit tests into the existing testing framework.

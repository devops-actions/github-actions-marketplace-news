## Action Summary

Sherpa.sh is a GitHub Action that leverages AI to automate infrastructure deployment by interpreting plain English prompts. It configures and manages servers, DNS, SSL, databases, load balancers, CDNs, and more across any cloud provider or framework, eliminating the need for manual YAML file configuration or specialized DevOps expertise. This open-source tool streamlines deployment, reduces complexity, and enhances flexibility by enabling developers to describe desired infrastructure and letting Sherpa handle the rest.

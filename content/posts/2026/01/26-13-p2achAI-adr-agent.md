## Action Summary

The ADR 2.0 GitHub Action automates the promotion of Agent Analysis Records (AARs) into formal Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), ensuring architectural decisions are documented, validated, and enforced with minimal manual effort. It streamlines AI-assisted development workflows by generating machine-readable ADRs, updating indexes, cleaning up processed AARs, and enabling continuous enforcement of architectural rules through CI validation. This action helps maintain architectural integrity and reduces documentation overhead in modern software projects.

## Action Summary

The TODO Registrar GitHub Action automates the process of scanning codebases for TODO/FIXME comments and converting them into issues in supported trackers like GitHub, GitLab, or JIRA. It prevents duplicate issues by injecting issue IDs back into the code and commits these changes directly to the repository, eliminating the need for external databases. This action streamlines issue management, reduces manual effort, and ensures efficient tracking of tasks within your codebase.

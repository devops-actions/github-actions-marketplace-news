## Action Summary

The "Branch Release" GitHub Action automates the process of releasing code by building distribution files and publishing them to a designated GitHub branch. It determines the next semantic version based on commit messages following the Conventional Commits standard, updates version tags, and generates GitHub release notes. This action simplifies release management by eliminating the need for manual version updates, tag management, and the inclusion of build artifacts in the source branch.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action verifies that the version specified in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `pyproject.toml` matches across files and is higher than the latest published tag based on semantic versioning rules. It automates version consistency checks and ensures proper version progression for npm, Cargo, or Poetry-managed projects, reducing the risk of deployment errors. Key features include identifying whether a version is new or a prerelease and providing metadata like build date and release tags.

## Action Summary

The EC2 SSM Docker Blue Green Deployment Action automates the deployment of Docker Compose-based applications on EC2 instances using a Blue/Green deployment strategy. It eliminates the need for managing SSH keys by leveraging AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for secure operations and ensures zero-downtime deployments by dynamically updating Nginx configurations and performing health checks before traffic switching. This action simplifies deployment workflows with automated container management, traffic routing, and cleanup of unused resources.

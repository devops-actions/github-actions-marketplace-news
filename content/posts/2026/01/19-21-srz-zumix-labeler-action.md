## Action Summary

The `labeler-action` is a GitHub Action designed to automate the labeling of pull requests and other events based on defined criteria in a label configuration file, such as `labeler.yml`. It extends the functionality of `actions/labeler` by supporting additional triggers (e.g., `push` or `workflow_dispatch` events), custom label color settings, and advanced configurations like team member expansion. This action simplifies and enhances workflow automation by enabling flexible labeling processes beyond standard pull request events.

## Action Summary

The `xfg` GitHub Action and CLI tool automates the synchronization of configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, or text files) across multiple repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. It simplifies tasks such as maintaining consistent settings (e.g., linters, formatters) across repositories by creating pull requests or directly pushing changes while supporting advanced features like templating, content inheritance, and multi-repo targeting. This action is ideal for enforcing organization-wide standards and managing distributed configurations efficiently.

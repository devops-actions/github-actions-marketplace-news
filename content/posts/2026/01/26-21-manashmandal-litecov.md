## Action Summary

LiteCov is a lightweight GitHub Action that automates code coverage reporting by detecting coverage files, supporting multiple formats (e.g., LCOV, Cobertura XML), and posting clear summaries as pull request comments. It eliminates the need for external infrastructure, simplifies integration, and provides features like commit status updates, customizable coverage thresholds, and clickable links to uncovered lines, enabling teams to easily track and improve test coverage.

## Example usage

```yaml

  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  migrate:
    name: Migrate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.20.x'

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: mscno/setup-goose@v1

      - run: goose up
```

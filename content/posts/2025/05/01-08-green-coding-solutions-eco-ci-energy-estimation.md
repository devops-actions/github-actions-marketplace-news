## Release notes

The May comes with some minor improvements that make every sustainability enthusiast ready for the summer! (Official end of stupid release message jokes :) )

- THanks to the input from @raits we have reworked the collapsing in PR comments to have all runs from the same *job_id* visible. 
- Thanks to @SimSon2710 we now have a nice user contributed machine running on Intel Xeon that helps other users select more power profiles but also walk through the PR (https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/eco-ci-energy-estimation/pull/123) to re-cap how the process of adding new data to Eco CI is done.
- Thanks to @SimSon2710 we now have some more bullet proofing and flexibility on where the *metrics.txt* is put on GitLab runs

Thanks folks! ❤️

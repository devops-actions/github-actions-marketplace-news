## Release notes

## Changes

This release adds the input `server-url` which defaults to `https://github.com`. You can set this to a custom url to control where this action downloads the uv release from. This is useful for users of gitea and comparable solutions.

@sebadevo pointed out that we don't invalidate the cache when the `prune-cache` input is changed. This leads to unnessecarily big caches. The input is now used to compute the cache key, properly invalidating the cache when it is changed.

> [!NOTE]  
> For most users this release will invalidate the cache once. 
> You will see the known warning [no-github-actions-cache-found-for-key](https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv?tab=readme-ov-file#why-do-i-see-warnings-like-no-github-actions-cache-found-for-key)
> This is expected and will only appear once.

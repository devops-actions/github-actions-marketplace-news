### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

**several breaking changes with details below**

There are several breaking changes in this release.
1. Replace `noDiffForStages` with `stackSelectionStrategy` &
`stackSelectorPatterns`
This uses the native selection stack filtering capability of
`toolkit-lib` and should be a more robust option for users to filter
stacks. `stackSelectorPatterns` also uses a multi-line input instead of
a comma delimited string input. To migrate from `noDiffForStages` to
`stackSelectorPatterns` you can do this:

```yaml
# from this
- name: Diff
   uses: corymhall/cdk-diff-action@v1
   with:
     noDiffForStages: "Stage1,Stage2"
     githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# to this
- name: Diff
   uses: corymhall/cdk-diff-action@v2
   with:
     stackSelectorPatterns: |
       !Stage1/*
       !Stage2/*
     githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
2. The default `diffMethod` is changed to `change-set` to match the cdk
default behavior. This also changes the IAM Role used for diff from the
`lookup-role` to the `deploy-role`. To keep the old behavior you can
specify `diffMethod: template-only`
3. `allowDestroyTypes` and `noFailOnDestructiveChanges` input types were
changed from a comma delimited string to a multi-line string.
```yaml
# from this
- name: Diff
   uses: corymhall/cdk-diff-action@v1
   with:
     noFailOnDestructiveChanges: "Stage1,Stage2"
     githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# to this
- name: Diff
   uses: corymhall/cdk-diff-action@v2
   with:
     noFailOnDestructiveChanges: |
       Stage1
       Stage2
     githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

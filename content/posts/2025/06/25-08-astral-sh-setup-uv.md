## Release notes

## Changes

This is a hotfix to change the warning messages that a version could not be found in the local manifest-file to info level.

A `setup-uv` release contains a version-manifest.json file with infos in all available `uv` releases. When a new `uv` version is released this is not contained in this file until the file gets updated and a new `setup-uv` release is made.
We will overhaul this process in the future but for now the spamming of warnings is removed.

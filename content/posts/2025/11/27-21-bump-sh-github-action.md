## Release notes

## 🆕  Support deployment of OpenAPI 3.2 documents 🎉 

OpenAPI 3.2 was published on 19 September 2025 [(see documentation)](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.2.0), and is now partially supported by Bump.sh.

This OAS version is supported by bump-cli since [last release to v2.9.9](https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/releases/tag/v2.9.9), hence the release of the GitHub action.

## Release notes

# 🕷️ SundAI LLM Honeypot Generator

This project injects misleading and invisible HTML content into webpages to protect against **naive web scrapers**. It uses **OpenAI's GPT models** to automatically generate and insert fake elements such as hidden `<div>`s, fake emails, phone numbers, and HTML comments, preserving the original page functionality while making it harder for bots to extract meaningful data.

## ✨ New Feature: Leverage Banned OpenAI names ✨

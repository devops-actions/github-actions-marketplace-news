## Release notes

## What's Changed
In short, there's less to manually setup, with the orphan branch being automatically created for you, and user-facing configuration is present in the default branch instead of being in the orphan branch to make it more accessible.

Most other changes are under the hood to prepare for TDD and gitlab support.

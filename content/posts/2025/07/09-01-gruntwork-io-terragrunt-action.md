## Release notes

## üõ†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### Container Usage Removed

This GitHub Action no longer uses a container to run Terragrunt/OpenTofu. 

It simply installs Terragrunt and OpenTofu directly on the runner using mise. The action also supports installing Terragrunt + OpenTofu without running any Terragrunt command on behalf of the user.

For more information on how to use this action, read the updated [README](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-action).

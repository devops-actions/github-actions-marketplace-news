## Release notes

Added a new option, `threshold_fixable_only`. When set to true, only vulnerabilities with a fix count towards threshold exceeded vulnerability counts. Vulnerabilities without a fix do not count towards the threshold. This option is intended to support workflows that wish to invoke custom logic, such as job failure, only when fixable vulnerabilities are present. 
- Resolves #91 

Added a new option, `show_only_fixable_vulns`. When enabled, the action will only display vulnerabilities for which a fix is available in the GitHub Actions step summary. Vulnerabilities without a fix are still present in the raw Inspector scan JSON or CSV. 
- ðŸŽ‰  Special thanks for the community contribution from @CarolMebiom! #115

Added reference in project README to the Amazon Inspector SBOM Generator software license: [AWS Intellectual Property License](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-ip-license-terms/).
- Resolves #120 

An example workflow demonstrating these new features is available [here](https://github.com/aws-actions/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector/blob/465e1da727a1cd39fb444f8e9c12cbb600549573/.github/workflows/test_vuln_thresholds.yml#L48).

## Release notes

## Changes

You can now use the `version-file` input to specify a file that contains the version of uv to install.
This can either be a `pyproject.toml` or `uv.toml` file which defines a `required-version` or
uv defined as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.

```yaml
- name: Install uv based on the version defined in requirements.txt
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
  with:
    version-file: "requirements.txt"
```

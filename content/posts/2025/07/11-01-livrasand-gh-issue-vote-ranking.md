## Release notes

Packaged Action with NCC

This release includes important improvements to ensure the action runs reliably in all GitHub workflows.

**Whatâ€™s new in v1.0.1:**

* **Bundled all dependencies using `@vercel/ncc`**
  The action is now fully self-contained. It no longer depends on external `node_modules`, which resolves the `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors reported in v1.0.0.

* Updated `action.yml` to point to the new bundled entry file (`dist/index.js`)

* Improved production-readiness and compatibility across GitHub-hosted runners

No changes were made to the core logic of the vote ranking system. This release focuses on packaging and execution stability.

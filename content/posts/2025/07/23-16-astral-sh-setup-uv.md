## Release notes

## Changes

This release will interpret relative paths in inputs as relative
to the value of `working-directory` (default is `${{ github.workspace }}`) .
This means the following configuration

```yaml
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
   with:
     working-directory: /my/path
     cache-dependency-glob: uv.lock
```
will look for the `cache-dependency-glob` under `/my/path/uv.lock`

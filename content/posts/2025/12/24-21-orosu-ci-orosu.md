## Action Summary

Órosu is a secure CI/CD delivery tool designed to replace traditional SSH/SCP-based deployment methods in GitHub Actions and other CI workflows. It eliminates the need for direct server access, fragile scripts, and scattered credentials by using a single server installation and secure WebSocket connections to trigger predefined deployment jobs. This streamlines deployment processes, reduces security risks, and improves maintainability across pipelines.

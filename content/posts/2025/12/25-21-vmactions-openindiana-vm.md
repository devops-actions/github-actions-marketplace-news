## Action Summary

This GitHub Action enables users to run CI workflows on OpenIndiana, an operating system not natively supported by GitHub Actions, which typically supports Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. It automates the setup of an OpenIndiana virtual machine, synchronizes files and environment variables between the host and VM, and provides configurable options for memory, CPU, file sharing, and network ports. This action is ideal for developers needing to test or build software specifically on OpenIndiana within their CI pipelines.

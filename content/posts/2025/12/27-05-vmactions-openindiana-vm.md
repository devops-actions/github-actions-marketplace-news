## Action Summary

This GitHub Action enables users to run continuous integration (CI) workflows on OpenIndiana, addressing the limitation of GitHub Actions supporting only Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS by default. It automates the creation of an OpenIndiana virtual machine (VM) for CI tasks, synchronizes files and environment variables between the host and the VM, and provides configurable options for resource allocation, code sharing, and network settings. This action is ideal for developers needing OpenIndiana-specific testing environments within GitHub workflows.

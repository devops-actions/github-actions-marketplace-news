## Action Summary

The `gen-pr` GitHub Action and CLI tool automates the creation of pull requests by leveraging AI (Large Language Models) to generate code implementations based on GitHub issues and pull request descriptions. It simplifies development workflows by allowing developers to focus on defining requirements, while AI handles the implementation process. The tool supports multiple AI coding assistants, integrates planning capabilities for better implementation strategies, and can be used flexibly either as a standalone CLI tool or within GitHub Actions.

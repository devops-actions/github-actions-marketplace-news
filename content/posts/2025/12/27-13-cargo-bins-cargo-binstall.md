## Action Summary

Cargo Binstall is a tool for efficiently installing Rust binary crates as an alternative to building from source with `cargo install`. It automates the process by fetching precompiled artifacts from CI releases, third-party hosts, or falling back to building from source, reducing overhead for developers and package maintainers. This action simplifies binary installation, supports unattended use in CI, and functions as a drop-in replacement for `cargo install` in many cases.

## Action Summary

The "Create Signed Commit Action" is a GitHub Action that automates the creation of signed commits using the GitHub API, with the option to push them immediately or batch multiple commits before pushing. It simplifies workflows by enabling precise control over commit operations, such as specifying file paths, parent commits, and target branches, while ensuring commits are signed and comply with repository protection rules. This action is especially useful for automating version control tasks, such as updating files, cherry-picking changes, or managing multi-commit operations.

## Action Summary

The `git-warp-time` GitHub Action and CLI utility automatically resets file modification timestamps in a Git repository's working directory to match the last commit that modified each file. This tool ensures file timestamps accurately reflect their version history, which can be useful for build systems or workflows that rely on file modification times. It supports both CLI usage and integration as a Rust library, automating the process of aligning timestamps with commit history.

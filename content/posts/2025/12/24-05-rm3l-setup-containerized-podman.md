The "Setup Containerized Podman Action" GitHub Action sets up a Podman environment within a Docker container, enabling users to run Podman and manage containerized workflows on GitHub Actions runners without encountering library incompatibilities. It leverages the host's Docker daemon for container operations while providing Podman for command parsing and orchestration, and includes support for installing Docker Compose or Podman Compose.

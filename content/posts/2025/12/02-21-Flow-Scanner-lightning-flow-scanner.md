## Release notes

**Released:** 2 December 2025

This release marks the inclusion of `lightning-flow-scanner-action` into our unified Turborepo + pnpm monorepo alongside `lightning-flow-scanner-core` and `lightning-flow-scanner-cli` at [lightning-flow-scanner](https://github.com/Flow-Scanner/lightning-flow-scanner)

#### Key Benefits Now Realized

- **Single repository for all components** – Core, CLI, and Action are now co-located, simplifying versioning and releases.
- **Consistent tooling and configuration** – The Action now uses the same TypeScript, linting, and build setup as core and CLI.
- **Simplified maintenance** – Shared scripts and dependencies reduce duplication and make updates faster.
- **Improved developer experience** – Action development and testing now fully leverage the monorepo setup, including parallel builds and shared core tests.
- **Marketplace-ready** – The GitHub Action is fully published with an updated Marketplace README, ready for usage in workflows.

## Action Summary

The `rust-clippy-reborn` GitHub Action is a next-generation tool for running Clippy, a Rust linter, on commits and pull requests in your repository. It improves upon the previous `actions-rs/clippy-check` by enhancing security (removing the need for `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and supporting pull requests from forked repositories. This action automates code linting for Rust projects, helping to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues in a seamless CI/CD workflow.

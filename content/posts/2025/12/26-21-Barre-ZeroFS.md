## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a high-performance filesystem that enables users to mount and interact with S3-compatible object storage as if it were a traditional filesystem. It supports file-level access via NFS and 9P, as well as block-level access via NBD, offering encryption, compression, and multi-layered caching for enhanced performance and security. This action simplifies the integration of S3 storage into workflows, making it suitable for applications such as ZFS, databases, and other systems requiring seamless access to object storage.

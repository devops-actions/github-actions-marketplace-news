## Action Summary

This GitHub Action allows users to run continuous integration (CI) workflows in an OpenIndiana virtual machine, addressing the limitation of GitHub Actions only supporting Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. It automates the setup of an OpenIndiana VM, synchronizes files and environment variables between the host and VM, and provides customizable options for memory, CPU, networking, and file sharing. This enables developers to test and build projects in an OpenIndiana environment seamlessly within their CI pipelines.

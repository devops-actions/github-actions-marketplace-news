The **Easy NPM Publish** GitHub Action streamlines the process of publishing npm packages by automating version updates, tagging, and publishing to npm-compatible registries. It leverages Conventional Commits to determine semantic versioning changes (major, minor, patch) based on commit messages, eliminating manual version management. Additionally, it automates the creation and updating of git tags, ensuring accurate version tracking and release management.

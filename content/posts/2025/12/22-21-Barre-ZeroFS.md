## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a filesystem solution that enables S3-compatible object storage to function as both a file-level and block-level storage system. It provides NFS, 9P, and NBD server capabilities, allowing users to access S3 storage as network filesystems or raw block devices for applications like ZFS and databases. By offering high performance, encryption, and seamless integration with S3, ZeroFS simplifies storage management and optimizes workflows for environments requiring scalable and secure storage solutions.

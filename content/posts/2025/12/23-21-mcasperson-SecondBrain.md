## Action Summary

SecondBrain is a CLI tool designed to access, filter, and analyze data from external sources like Salesforce, Slack, and GitHub using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques in combination with a Large Language Model (LLM). It automates tasks such as generating insights, summaries, and reports by extracting relevant data based on keywords and querying it for analysis. This tool is particularly valuable for consolidating and deriving insights from disconnected data sources, including files, code repositories, and video transcripts.

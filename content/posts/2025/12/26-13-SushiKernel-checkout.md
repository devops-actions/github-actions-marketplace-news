## Action Summary

The "Checkout V4" GitHub Action automates the process of checking out a repository to the `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` in workflows, enabling subsequent workflow steps to access the repository's files. It supports authenticated Git operations, handles single-commit or full history fetching, and provides fallback mechanisms for environments lacking Git. This action simplifies repository access and ensures secure handling of credentials during workflow execution.

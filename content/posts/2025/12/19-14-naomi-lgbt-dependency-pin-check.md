## Release notes

# BREAKING CHANGE

This version requires the new `language` option, because we now support multiple languages!!!

Unfortunately, most of our work (outside of client NDA work) is in TypeScript, so we have not adequately tested the other languages. If you encounter issues, please let us know on [Discord](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com).

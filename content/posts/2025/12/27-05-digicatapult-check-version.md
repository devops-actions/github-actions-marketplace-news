## Action Summary

This GitHub Action validates version consistency across package managers (npm, Cargo, and Poetry) by ensuring the version specified in configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) matches and is higher than the latest published tag based on semantic versioning. It automates version comparison tasks to enforce proper versioning practices, detect outdated or mismatched versions, and prevent accidental version conflicts during releases.

## Action Summary

Orosu is a CI/CD offloading tool that simplifies build delivery by eliminating the need for ad-hoc SSH/SFTP setups, brittle scripts, and direct server exposure in CI pipelines. It acts as a controlled execution point where CI systems trigger jobs, and Orosu handles them locally on the target machine with predefined scripts, streamlining deployment and reducing complexity. This tool is ideal for improving security, reducing configuration overhead, and standardizing job execution.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action, "Provision EC2 Runner," automates the process of launching EC2 instances from custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to serve as GitHub self-hosted runners for repository-level workflows. It simplifies the runner lifecycle by allowing on-the-fly registration or pre-configured AMI setups, addressing the need for scalable, on-demand compute resources for CI/CD pipelines. The action integrates with AWS and GitHub, providing flexibility and security for managing self-hosted runners in private repositories.

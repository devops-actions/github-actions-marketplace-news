## Action Summary

Flowlyt is an AI-powered security analyzer designed to enhance the security of CI/CD pipelines for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD workflows. It combines traditional static code analysis with AI-driven capabilities, such as false positive detection, context-aware analysis, and real-time vulnerability verification, to identify and mitigate security risks like misconfigurations, secrets exposure, and supply chain vulnerabilities. By supporting multiple AI providers and leveraging advanced techniques like Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis, Flowlyt automates security assessments, reduces false positives, and provides actionable insights to streamline secure pipeline development.

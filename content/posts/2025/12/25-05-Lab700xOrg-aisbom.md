## Action Summary

AIsbom is a security and compliance scanner designed specifically for Machine Learning (ML) artifacts. It performs deep binary introspection on model files to identify hidden malware risks and potential legal license violations, going beyond traditional SBOM tools that only analyze dependency files. Key capabilities include local and remote scanning, strict allowlisting for high-security environments, CI/CD integration to block risky builds, and generating detailed compliance reports in CycloneDX format.

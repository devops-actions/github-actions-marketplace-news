## Action Summary

The `gpgsign` GitHub Action automates the process of signing files or artifacts using GnuPG, ensuring their integrity and authenticity. It solves the problem of manually creating GPG signatures by providing capabilities such as signing files in bulk, generating detached or clear text signatures, and excluding specific files from the signing process. This action is ideal for workflows requiring secure and verifiable file distribution.

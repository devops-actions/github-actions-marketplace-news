- This action is used across all versions by **2** repositories.

## Action Summary

The **Determine Version GitHub Action** automates the process of identifying whether a project's version has advanced compared to the latest matching Git tag, using semantic versioning. It outputs the new version for publishing or indicates "no changes" if the version has not progressed, streamlining version management and release workflows. Key capabilities include reading the version from a specified file, filtering tags with a regex pattern, and performing semantic comparisons to determine updates.

## Release notes

This is an update that has been automatically built. For the love
of all that is holy, unholy, or morally grey, someone please take
the keyboard away from me. I'm going to run out of repo space soon.

## Action Summary

SecondBrain is a CLI tool designed to access, filter, and analyze data from external sources like Salesforce, ZenDesk, Slack, and more, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It automates the extraction of relevant information based on keywords and enables users to query this data using a Large Language Model (LLM), helping generate insights, summaries, and reports from disparate data sources. Key capabilities include analyzing document directories, summarizing GitHub changes, and processing YouTube transcripts to derive actionable insights.

## Action Summary

The `git-matching-commits` GitHub Action automates the process of identifying commits between two git references (e.g., tags, branches, SHAs) that are associated with Pull Requests containing specific GitHub labels. It supports both merge and squash commit workflows, ensuring that only commits tied to labeled PRs are included. This action is particularly useful for filtering relevant changes in a repository based on PR labels, simplifying tasks like release notes generation or targeted change tracking.

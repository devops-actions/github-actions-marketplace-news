## Action Summary

The **TODO Registrar Action** is a GitHub Action designed to scan codebases for TODO/FIXME comments, create corresponding issues in supported issue trackers (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, JIRA), and inject issue IDs back into comments to prevent duplicate tickets. It automates the management of TODOs, eliminates the need for a separate database, and provides flexible inline configuration for issue customization, streamlining the process of tracking and resolving code-related tasks.

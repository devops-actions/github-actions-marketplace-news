## Action Summary

The GitHub Activity Scoring System (GASS) is a GitHub Action designed to automate the analysis of developer contributions and connect those metrics to token distribution in a fair, transparent, and decentralized manner. It addresses issues in traditional airdrops, such as lack of transparency and vulnerability to Sybil attacks, by leveraging GitHub activity data to allocate rewards based on quality, recency, and volume of contributions. Key capabilities include automated contribution analysis, secure on-chain data storage, and integration with smart contracts for rule-based token allocation.

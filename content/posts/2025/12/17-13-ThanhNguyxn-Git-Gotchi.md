## Release notes

## 🏆 Legendary Pet System v2.3.0

### ✨ New Features

**4 New Legendary Creatures!**
Unlock special creatures by achieving milestones. Harder achievements take priority.

| Legendary | Trigger | Difficulty |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| 🦖 **Mecha-Rex** | 1000+ commits | 🔥 Hardest |
| 🐉 **Hydra** | 5+ languages | 💪 Hard |
| 🗿 **Cyber Golem** | 50+ closed issues | 🛠️ Medium |
| 👻 **Void Spirit** | Night coder (00:00-04:00) | 🌙 Conditional |
| 🦄 **Unicorn** | ⭐ Star or 🍴 Fork this repo | ✨ Entry Level |

**Priority Logic:** Hardest achievement wins! If you have 1000+ commits AND 5+ languages, you get Mecha-Rex (not Hydra).

### 🎨 Pixel Art Designs
Each legendary has 6 mood variants (Happy, Sleeping, Ghost, Hyper, Night Owl, Weekend).

- **Mecha-Rex:** Cybernetic T-Rex with green metal plating (horizontal posture, distinct from Robot)
- **Hydra:** 3-headed purple serpent (distinct from single-headed Snake)
- **Cyber Golem:** Blocky stone construct with neon blue circuits
- **Void Spirit:** Floating hooded spectre with glowing eyes

### 📖 Gallery Updates
- Added Legendary Pets showcase with preview images
- Added unlock requirements and priority table

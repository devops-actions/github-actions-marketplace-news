## Action Summary

The `setup-fvm` GitHub Action automates the setup of FVM (Flutter Version Management) by installing FVM, managing the Flutter SDK, and running package resolution commands (`fvm flutter pub get`). It also caches the Flutter SDK and Pub packages to improve build performance, even preserving the cache if the job fails, streamlining Flutter project workflows.

## Release notes

## 🔧 Fix

- Support FVM v4

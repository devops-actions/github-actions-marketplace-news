## Action Summary

The **GitHub Actions Dependency Submission** is a tool designed to automate the scanning of workflow files in a repository to identify and submit GitHub Actions dependencies to GitHub's Dependency Graph. It simplifies dependency management by detecting and processing composite actions, callable workflows, and forked repositories, ensuring that security advisories are tracked accurately. This action supports custom directory scanning, fork traversal, and advanced pattern matching, making it particularly useful for maintaining secure and comprehensive dependency tracking in complex GitHub environments.

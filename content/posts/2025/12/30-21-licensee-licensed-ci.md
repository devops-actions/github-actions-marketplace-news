## Action Summary

The `licensed-ci` GitHub Action automates license compliance checks in CI workflows by leveraging the `licensee/licensed` tool. It ensures that dependency license metadata is up-to-date, valid, and compliant by caching license data and performing status checks. This action streamlines the process of managing dependency licenses, with flexible workflows for updating metadata, creating pull requests, or handling bot-initiated changes, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent compliance management.

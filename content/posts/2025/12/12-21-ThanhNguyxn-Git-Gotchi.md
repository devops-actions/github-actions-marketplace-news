## Release notes

## Bug Fix: Visibility on Light Backgrounds

Added a subtle semi-transparent background with rounded corners to all pet SVGs.

**Before:** Pets with white colors (Unicorn, Alpaca) were invisible on white/light backgrounds.

**After:** All pets now have a soft, rounded background that makes them visible on any theme (light or dark).

No functionality changes - just improved visual compatibility! 👀

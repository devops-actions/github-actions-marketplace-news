## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the generation of a software bill of materials (SBOM) using Syft, simplifying the process of analyzing software components and dependencies. It can scan container images, directories, or files, and produces SBOMs in SPDX format, which can be uploaded as workflow artifacts or GitHub release assets. This action helps developers ensure transparency and security in software supply chains while streamlining SBOM creation and management.

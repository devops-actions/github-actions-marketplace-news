## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the process of verifying and comparing version numbers in project files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`) against the latest published Git tag using semantic versioning rules. It ensures that the version in your project files is consistent and higher than the current published version, helping to prevent versioning conflicts and streamline release management. The action supports multiple package managers, including npm, Cargo, and Poetry, and provides useful outputs like version details and release tags.

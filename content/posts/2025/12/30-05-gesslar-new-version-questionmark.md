## Action Summary

The "Determine Version GitHub Action" automates the process of comparing a project's current version (from a specified file like `package.json`) with the latest Git tag matching a defined pattern. It outputs the next version to publish if the current version is newer or indicates `no changes` otherwise. This action streamlines version management by ensuring accurate semantic comparisons and reducing manual checks.

## Release notes

This is an update that has been automatically built. For the love of all that is holy, unholy, or morally grey, someone please take the keyboard away from me. I'm going to run out of repo space soon.

## Action Summary

The `jd` GitHub Action is a tool for diffing and patching JSON and YAML files, providing a streamlined way to compare and apply changes between file versions. It supports multiple diff and patch formats, including its native `jd` format, JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386), and JSON Patch (RFC 6902), while offering human-readable outputs and minimal diffs. This action automates the process of generating, translating, and applying structural patches, simplifying tasks like configuration management and version control of structured data.

## Action Summary

ZeroFS is a filesystem solution that transforms S3-compatible storage into a high-performance, encrypted filesystem with file-level access via NFS and 9P, and block-level access via NBD. It automates the process of using S3 as primary storage for tasks like running ZFS, databases, or compiling and managing large datasets, while ensuring encryption, caching, and POSIX compliance. ZeroFS addresses storage performance and compatibility challenges, enabling efficient use of S3 for diverse applications.

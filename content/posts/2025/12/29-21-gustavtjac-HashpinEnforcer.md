## Action Summary

The **GitHub Actions Hashpin Enforcer** is a security-focused tool that scans workflow YAML files to ensure all actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs, preventing the use of mutable references like tags (`@v1`) or branches (`@main`). It automates the detection of non-deterministic dependencies, improving the reproducibility and security of CI/CD pipelines by mitigating risks such as malicious code injection, breaking changes, and unpredictable builds. The action provides clear failure reports and works out of the box with no configuration required.

## Action Summary

The **Link Validator GitHub Action** automates the process of validating links and URLs in Markdown files to ensure they are functional and accurate. It checks GitHub links, external HTTP(S) URLs, local file references, and Datadog URLs, supporting both public GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server. By integrating into CI workflows, it helps catch and fix broken links during PR reviews, preventing issues like link rot, inaccessible references, or outdated API endpoints, thus improving the reliability and user experience of project documentation.

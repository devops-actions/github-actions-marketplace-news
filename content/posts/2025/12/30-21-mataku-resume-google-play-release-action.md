## Action Summary

The "Resume Google Play Release Action" is a GitHub Action designed to automate the process of resuming halted app releases in the Google Play Console for specific tracks (e.g., production, beta). It determines the appropriate release status—`inProgress` for staged rollouts or `completed` for full releases—and supports authentication via Service Account or Workload Identity Federation. This action streamlines release management, minimizing manual intervention and providing detailed logging for troubleshooting.

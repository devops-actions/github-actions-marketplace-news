## Action Summary

SecondBrain is a CLI tool designed to retrieve, filter, and analyze data from multiple external sources such as Salesforce, ZenDesk, Slack, and others using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It automates tasks like extracting relevant data based on keywords and querying it via a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate reports, summaries, and insights from otherwise disconnected data sources. Key capabilities include analyzing directories of documents, summarizing GitHub repository changes, and processing YouTube transcripts for specific topics.

## Action Summary

The **Terraform Plan Commenter Action** is a GitHub Action that automates the execution of `terraform plan` and posts a detailed, formatted summary of the plan as a comment on pull requests. It updates the comment with each new push, enabling reviewers to easily view proposed infrastructure changes without needing direct access to Terraform. Key features include handling large plans, support for multi-directory setups (e.g., in monorepos), and displaying import counts, making it a valuable tool for simplifying and streamlining Terraform-related code reviews.

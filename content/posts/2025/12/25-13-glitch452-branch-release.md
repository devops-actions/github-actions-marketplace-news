## Action Summary

The "Branch Release" GitHub Action automates the release process for projects that require built distribution files to be published to a specific GitHub branch. It leverages Conventional Commits to determine version updates, generate changelogs, and create GitHub releases with semantic versioning. This action streamlines tasks like building project files, managing version tags, and updating release branches, eliminating the need for manual version tracking and distribution management.

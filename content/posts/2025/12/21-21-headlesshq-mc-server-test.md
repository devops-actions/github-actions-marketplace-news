## Action Summary

MC-Server-Test is a GitHub Action that automates the process of running Minecraft production servers in CI/CD pipelines, enabling developers to test server mods, plugins, and configurations across various Minecraft versions and server types (e.g., Paper, Fabric, Forge, Neoforge, Vanilla). It addresses the challenges of manual testing for runtime bugs, such as mixin or remapping issues, by streamlining server launches and allowing custom command interactions for testing. This action is designed to improve efficiency in identifying and resolving server-specific issues during development.

## Action Summary

The **No Barrel File** GitHub Action and CLI tool detects and replaces imports from barrel files (e.g., `index.ts` files that re-export modules) with direct file paths. It automates the process of eliminating barrel file usage to improve tree-shaking, reduce bundle size, optimize test performance, and prevent circular dependency issues. This tool is particularly useful for maintaining efficient and performant codebases by enforcing or automatically fixing import structures in CI/CD workflows.

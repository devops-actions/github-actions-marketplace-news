## Action Summary

The "Branch Release" GitHub Action automates the process of releasing code by generating and publishing distribution files to a specified GitHub branch. It leverages Conventional Commits to determine version updates, automatically creates release notes, builds the project, and tags the release with semantic versioning. This action simplifies version management, automates release workflows, and eliminates the need to manually track or update release branches with distribution files.

## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the validation of version consistency across package.json, package-lock.json, Cargo.toml, and pyproject.toml files and ensures that the local version is higher than the latest published tag based on semantic versioning. It helps maintain versioning accuracy and prevents accidental releases with outdated or mismatched version numbers. Key capabilities include detecting version mismatches, identifying prerelease versions, and validating against custom tag patterns.

## Action Summary

The **gh-rmrf** GitHub Action is designed to reclaim disk space on GitHub-hosted runners by removing unnecessary pre-installed software and optionally merging multiple disks into a single large volume. It automates cleanup tasks to free up to 20GB or more of storage and can create a unified ~100GB workspace for builds, with optional Btrfs compression for additional efficiency. This action addresses the problem of limited disk space on runners, enhancing build performance and resource availability.

## Action Summary

The Content Reviewer GitHub Action is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically review and provide feedback on content changes in pull requests. It identifies issues in modified files, such as markdown documents, and leaves structured inline comments with severity levels (error, warning, suggestion) directly on the PR. This action streamlines the content review process by automating quality checks, supporting multilingual content, and integrating with LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

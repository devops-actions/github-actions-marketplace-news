## Action Summary

The **Unentropy Quality Gate** GitHub Action evaluates pull request (PR) metrics against predefined baseline thresholds to identify potential regressions and posts results as PR comments. It automates the process of monitoring code quality by detecting metric degradations and optionally enforcing quality gates to prevent merging if thresholds are not met. Key features include configurable storage backends, flexible gate modes (off, soft, hard), and detailed PR feedback through comments with metric summaries.

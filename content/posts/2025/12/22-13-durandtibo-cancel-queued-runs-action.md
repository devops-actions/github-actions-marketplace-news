## Action Summary

The **Cancel Queued Runs Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automatically cancel workflow runs that remain in the queued state beyond a configurable time limit. It helps maintain clean workflow queues and prevents backlogs by ensuring stale or delayed runs are canceled. This lightweight action supports both private and public repositories and requires only the GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

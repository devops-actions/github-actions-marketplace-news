## Action Summary

This GitHub Action automates the execution of Eclipse Source Clean-Ups, replicating the functionality of the `Source -> Clean Up` menu in Eclipse IDE. It allows users to configure and apply a variety of code cleanup tasks, such as formatting, optimizing control statements, improving code style, and adopting modern Java features. By automating these tasks, it simplifies code refactoring, enforces consistent coding standards, and streamlines the process of maintaining clean and optimized codebases.

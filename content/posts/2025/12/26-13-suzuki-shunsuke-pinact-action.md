## Action Summary

The `pinact-action` is a GitHub Action designed to automate the process of pinning versions of GitHub Actions and reusable workflows in workflow files. It ensures that all actions referenced in `.github/workflows/*.yml` and other configuration files are pinned to specific versions for consistency and security, preventing issues caused by unpinned or outdated dependencies. Additionally, it can validate these files to enforce pinning, with the option to push changes or fail CI if pinning is not applied.

## Action Summary

Drift Radar is a GitHub Action that analyzes Pull Requests to assess their structural risk through a computed "Drift Score" (0–100), focusing on factors like file criticality, configuration changes, and historical drift patterns. It automates risk detection by posting a detailed comment on each PR, helping teams identify potentially risky changes before they are merged. This action provides a fast, deterministic, and zero-configuration way to enhance code review processes and reduce long-term technical debt.

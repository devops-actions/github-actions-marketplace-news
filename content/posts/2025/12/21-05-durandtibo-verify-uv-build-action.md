## Action Summary

The `verify-uv-build-action` GitHub Action automates the process of building Python packages using the `uv` package manager and verifying their quality, metadata, and installability. It solves the problem of ensuring that Python packages meet high standards by performing tasks like build validation, type checking, metadata validation, dependency verification, and import testing. This action streamlines package quality assurance and supports both wheel and source distributions with flexible configuration options.

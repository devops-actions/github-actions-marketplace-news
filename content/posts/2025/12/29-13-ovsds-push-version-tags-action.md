## Action Summary

The "Push Version Tags Action" is a GitHub Action designed to automate the creation of supplementary version tags (e.g., major and minor tags) for a repository based on a base version. For instance, given a version like `v1.2.3`, it can automatically generate tags such as `v1` and `v1.2`. This action simplifies version management by ensuring consistent tagging practices, particularly useful for repositories that rely on semantic versioning.

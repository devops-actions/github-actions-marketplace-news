## Action Summary

This GitHub Action tracks and reports the GitHub API usage of a workflow job by capturing the API rate-limit state at the start and end of the job. It automates the process of monitoring how many API requests are consumed, categorized by rate-limit buckets (e.g., core, GraphQL, search), and provides a summary of usage in a structured JSON format. This helps developers optimize API usage and avoid exceeding rate limits during workflows.

## Action Summary

The "Easy NPM Publish" GitHub Action automates the process of versioning, tagging, and publishing npm packages. It uses Conventional Commits to determine version updates (major, minor, or patch), updates git tags accordingly, and publishes the package to npm or compatible registries. This streamlines package management by eliminating manual updates, ensuring consistent versioning, and automating the release workflow.

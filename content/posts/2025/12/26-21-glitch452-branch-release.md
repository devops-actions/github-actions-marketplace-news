## Action Summary

The "Branch Release" GitHub Action automates the process of releasing code by publishing built distribution files to a designated GitHub branch. It utilizes Conventional Commits to determine version updates, generates release notes, builds the project, tags the release with semantic versioning, and creates a GitHub release. This action simplifies release management by eliminating the need to manually update versions, track dist files in the source branch, or handle release branching and tagging.

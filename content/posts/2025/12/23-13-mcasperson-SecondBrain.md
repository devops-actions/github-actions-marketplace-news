## Action Summary

SecondBrain is a command-line tool that integrates with external data sources like Salesforce, ZenDesk, Slack, and others, to retrieve, filter, and analyze data using a Large Language Model (LLM).

Key features include analyzing document directories, summarizing GitHub repository changes, and processing YouTube video transcripts for actionable insights.

## Action Summary

SecondBrain is a command-line tool that integrates with external data sources (e.g., Salesforce, Slack, ZenDesk) and uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to filter and query data via a Large Language Model (LLM). It automates tasks such as data retrieval, keyword filtering, and generating insights or summaries from disconnected data sources, making it useful for report generation, document analysis, and summarizing content from platforms like GitHub or YouTube. The tool provides capabilities for analyzing directories, comparing GitHub changes, and processing YouTube transcripts to extract meaningful insights efficiently.

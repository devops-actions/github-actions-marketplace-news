## Action Summary

The Changelog.Action GitHub Action automates the process of updating and managing a project's changelog file following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) standard. It updates version information and moves content from the `[Unreleased]` section to the appropriate release section, simplifying changelog maintenance and ensuring consistency. Additionally, it provides a `release-notes` output that can be used for generating GitHub release notes or other automation tasks.

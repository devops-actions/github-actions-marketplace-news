## Action Summary

The **Create Signed Commit Action** is a GitHub Action that automates the creation of signed commits using the GitHub API without immediately pushing them, enabling batch commit operations. It addresses the need for programmatic and secure commit creation, supports specifying files, branches, and parent commits, and provides flexibility for workflows requiring multiple commits. The action ensures commits are automatically signed, with options to push changes or fetch the created commit locally.

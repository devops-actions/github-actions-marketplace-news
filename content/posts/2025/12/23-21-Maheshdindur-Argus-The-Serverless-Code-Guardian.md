## Action Summary

Argus is a serverless AI-powered code reviewer that operates within GitHub Actions pipelines to automate Pull Request analysis. It identifies security vulnerabilities, logic bugs, and coding issues by leveraging Google Gemini AI, providing automated feedback and blocking merges for problematic code.

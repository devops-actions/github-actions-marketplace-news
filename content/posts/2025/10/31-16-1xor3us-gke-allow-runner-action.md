## Release notes

üîê Release v1.1.0 ‚Äî Secure Provenance with SLSA v1

This release introduces **SLSA v1 provenance attestation** and enhanced supply chain integrity via **Sigstore keyless signing**.

üß© What‚Äôs new
- ‚úÖ **SLSA Provenance v1 support** ‚Äî replaces legacy `v0.2` predicate with the official `v1` format.
- ‚úÖ **Keyless signing via GitHub OIDC** (no private key needed).
- ‚úÖ **Full in-toto / DSSE attestation** published to GHCR (.att files).
- ‚úÖ **Cosign verification compatibility** with the latest cosign verify-attestation.
- ‚úÖ **Updated README** ‚Äî includes reproducible build verification & provenance validation steps.

No change to:
- Inputs, outputs, or behavior of the Action
- Binary code or runtime logic
- Security permissions or required scopes

üß† Why this matters
This upgrade brings **transparent, verifiable builds**:
anyone can confirm that the container image you use was built directly from this repository‚Äôs source code ‚Äî with a full cryptographic audit trail.

This means:
No human signing key
No opaque CI pipeline
Complete traceability from source ‚Üí build ‚Üí container

Built using the [SLSA GitHub Generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 with provenance signed via **Sigstore Fulcio + Rekor transparency logs**.
